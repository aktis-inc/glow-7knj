lyrics = [intro - serene flow]

[verse 1 - Nature's Call]  
ooooo  
Strings whisper, echo through trees  
Tabla beats, heartbeats align  
iiiiiiiii  
Soft chants, river's song  

[chorus - Urban Harmony]  
wooooo  
In the city hum, find peace  
Where the old meets new  
aaaaaa  

[bridge - Ethereal Blend]  
Melodies blend, souls unite  
Harmony in contrast  
shhhhhh  
oooooo  

[verse 2 - Timeless Echo]  
Tradition's voice, modern flow  
Serene paths, unseen roads  
eeeee  
Together, a journey unfolds  

[outro - Peaceful Descent]  
iiiiii  
Xylo's call, gentle and true  
In sound, find your path  
ahhhhh

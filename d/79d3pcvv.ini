lyrics = [intro - City Pulse]
(Street ambiance)  
oooooo

[verse 1 - Urban Echoes]  
On the streets where shadows play,  
Voices rise, in vibrant sway,  
Beats collide with footsteps' pace,  
Lost in rhythm, city’s grace  
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[Chorus - Neon Drift]  
wooooooo  
Nirva calls, through the night,  
In the glow of city light  
iiiiiii

[Bridge - Pulse of Life]  
Echoes bounce, off concrete walls,  
Every step, a story calls  
Ahhhhhh

[verse 2 - Grit and Grace]  
In the chaos, find your beat,  
Every corner, life’s retreat,  
Voices blend, a sound unique  
[glitch build-up]  
ssshhhh oooo  

[outro - Fade to Vibes]

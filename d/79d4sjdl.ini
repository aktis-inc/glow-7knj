lyrics = [intro - gentle rustle]

[verse 1 – Golden Ink]  
Pages whisper secrets untold  
Lines of life, stories unfold  
In the quiet, echoes remain  
Silent screams, joy and pain

[chorus – Echoes of the Past]  
ooooo  
Liora's heart, a diary's cast  
Words inscribed, memories vast  
woooo iiiii

[bridge - Reflections]  
Scribbles of dreams and fears  
Moments lost, time in tears  
In golden ink, emotions sway  
Life's journey, night and day

[outro - Fading Pages]  
Soft tones, a gentle breeze  
Whispers fade, leaves in trees  
oooo ahhhh  
Liora's tale, in melodies

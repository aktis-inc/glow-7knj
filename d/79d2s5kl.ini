[verse 1 – Dawning Pathway]  
Voices whisper through the mist  
Each step in tune with the earth  
A melody of ancient roots

[Chorus – Echo of Dira]  
Ahhhh... aaaaah  
The path is woven in song  
Guided by stars above  
Dira leads us on

[Bridge - Sacred Journey]  
Between the worlds, we wander  
Threads of time, we weave  
In the silence, stories breathe

[verse 2 – Harmonious Quest]  
The river sings our past  
Mountains echo the future  
In Dira’s light, we find our way

[outro - fading echoes]  
Ahhh... ooooh...  
Whispered dreams, eternal...

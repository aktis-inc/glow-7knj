sunlight in my veins
oooooo iiiiiii

[verse 1 – Urban Pulse]
streets alive with stories
echoes in the breeze
every corner whispers
dreams that never freeze
aaaaaaa

[Pre-Chorus – Rising Tide]
woooo
step by step we’re soaring
never looking back
hearts in sync, we’re roaring

[Chorus – Sunlit Echoes]
ooooo
iiiiiiii
nothing can stop us now

[Bridge - Electric Waves]
electric in the air
we’re dancing through the night
ooooo
our spirits taking flight

[outro - Fade to Dawn]
iiiiii
oooooo
sunlit echoes, our eternal song

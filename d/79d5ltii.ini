lyrics = [intro - Thunder Roll]

[verse 1]
In shadows I stand, heart in hand
Your light a distant star, far away
ooooo

[chorus - Storm's Cry]
I'm falling, deeper into the void
Reaching for you, like rain to the soil
iiiiii

[bridge - Heart's Echo]
Every tear, a silent scream
Lost in the storm, chasing the dream
aaaaa

[verse 2]
Your whisper's a ghost, haunting my night
Love's a storm, wild and untamed
ooooo

[outro - Talih of Love]
Lightning fades, heartbeats slow
In this tempest, my love will grow
zzzzzz

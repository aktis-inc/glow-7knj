[verse 1 – City Pulse]
Gema langkah di jalan
Lampu kota menari, kita berlari

[Pre-Chorus – Urban Echo]  
Suara kota membisik
Di antara gedung tinggi

[Chorus – Rivara's Wave]  
wooooooo  
aaaaaaahhh

[Bridge - Skyline Dance] 
Mengejar harapan, melintas batas
Ritme kota, suara kita

[guitar solo]  
iiiiii ooooo

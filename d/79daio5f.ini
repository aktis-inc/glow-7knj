lyrics = [intro - crackling fire]
(female vocal) In the shadows, whispers ignite
(male vocal) Flames rise, our spirits unite

[verse 1 - Dance of Defiance]
Guitar strings pulse with heartbeats
Brass echoes, calling us to the streets
Accordion sings tales untold
In the fire's warmth, we grow bold

[Pre-Chorus - Ember's Call]
(female vocal) We won't fade into the night
(male vocal) Together, we'll burn bright

[Chorus - Blaze of Freedom]
wooooooo
iiiiiii
We dance in the fire's light
oooooo

[Bridge - Inferno's Edge]
(male vocal) Voices rise, a symphony of change
(female vocal) In the blaze, we rearrange
Ahhhhh shhhhhhh
[echoed harmony]

[verse 2]
In the city's heart, we ignite
Our steps, a rhythm of the fight
Grit and hope intertwined
In the inferno, we find our kind

[outro - Drift to Silence]
(male and female vocal) In the ashes, we'll find a new dawn
ooooo iiiii
The fire's song carries on

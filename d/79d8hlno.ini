lyrics = [intro - feedback surge]
[verse]  
Driving through this concrete jungle  
Lights blur past in a haze  
Every thought a thunderstorm  
Raging through my mind  
[chorus]  
Overdrive, emotions collide  
I can't escape this feeling inside  
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii  
[bridge - guitar solo]  
[verse]  
Words echo in the chaos  
Each step on shattered ground  
The city screams a silent song  
Lost but never found  
[chorus]  
Overdrive, emotions collide  
I can't escape this feeling inside  
oooooo  
[outro - fade into night]

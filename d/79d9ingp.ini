[verse 1]
In moonlit whispers, hearts collide  
Under stars, we softly glide  
ooooo aaaa

[chorus]
Linger, linger, in this time  
Where love writes its endless rhyme  
iiiiii iiiii

[bridge]
Memories like a gentle stream  
Floating in a golden dream  
oooo ooooo

[outro]
Whispers fade into the night  
In our hearts, love's warmest light  
aaaa iiiii

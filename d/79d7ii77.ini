lyrics = [intro - Rhythmic Echoes]

[verse – Hidden Path]
Dancing shadows, whispered tales  
Through the forests, where legends sail  
oooooo iiiiiii  

[Pre-Chorus – Spirit's Call]  
The drums beat, hearts align  
In the rhythm, stories intertwine

[Chorus – Vibrant Horizon]  
wooooooo  
Ride the wind, cross the line  
oooooo aaaa

[Bridge - Mystical Journey]  
Beyond the hills, secrets unfold  
Voices ancient, tales retold  
oooooo  
shhhhhhh

[verse 2]
Feet on earth, eyes to the sky  
Guiding stars, a silent cry  
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[Outro – Path of Echoes]  
iiiiiiii oooooo  
Journey ends, where it began…

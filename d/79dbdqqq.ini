lyrics = [intro - Desert Whisper]
(soft echoing chant) oooooo  
(haunting strings) iiiiiiii

[verse - Memory's Veil]
Through the sands, stories weave  
Ancient echoes, hearts believe  
Veil dances with whispers' grace  
In the wind, time leaves a trace  
ooooo

[chorus - Echoes of the Past]
Resonance in the distant call  
Souls entwined, rise and fall  
In the shadow of the moon, we sing  
Veil of echoes, memories bring  
ooooo  
iiiiiiii

[bridge - Lament's Embrace]
In the silence, voices soar  
Veil of sorrow, forevermore  
oooooooo

[outro - Fade to Silence]
(soft echoing chant) ooooo
(whispering wind) iiiiiii

lyrics = [intro - ancient whispers]

[verse - echoing tales]

Mizra speaks in the wind, softly calling
Through valleys, the echoes flow
iiiiii ooo aaah

[chorus - rhythmic dance]

Drums of the earth, heartbeats align
Melodies weave through time
ooooo iiiii

[bridge - mystical flow]

Strings of the past, voices intertwine
In Mizra's embrace, we find

[outro - serene fade]

Ethereal tones, fading light
Mizra's song in the night

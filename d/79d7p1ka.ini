[verse 1 - City Murmurs]  
In the city's whispered secrets  
Where the lights softly gleam  
Steps echo through the silence  
Chasing shadows in a dream  
  
[Pre-Chorus - Night's Embrace]  
Beneath the stars, we wander  
Hearts in sync, we ponder  
  
[Chorus - Echoes of Us]  
ooooo  
iiiiii  
Together we write stories  
In the echoes of the night  
ooooo  
iiiiii  
  
[Bridge - Acoustic Reverie]  
Dreams are woven in moonlight  
Carried on the breeze  
As the world fades behind us  
We find our own release  
  
[outro - Fading Light]  
ohhhhhh  
In the night's embrace, we stay  
With echoes guiding our way  
ooooo  
iiiiii

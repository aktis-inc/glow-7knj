[verse]
In the valley's embrace
Where echoes trace
Time's gentle hand  
oooooo aaaaaaa

[chorus - Mountain Pulse]
Drums of earth beat  
iiiiii iiiii  
Flutes sing tales untold

[bridge - Ethereal Drift]
Mystic fog, neon glow  
sssshhhhh ooooo  
Traditions merge with stars  
aaaaaa

[outro - Fade to Silence]

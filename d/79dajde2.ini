iiiiiiii

[verse]
Skies whisper tales of stars
In the dance of light, we find
Every beat, a cosmic spark
Kinetic dreams, intertwined

[chorus]

[bridge]
Chasing the neon glow
Through the rain and the mist
In the pulse of the city, we flow

[drop]

ssshhhh oooo

[verse]
Echoes of the future call
In every step, we see
A world where dreams won't fall

[outro]
woooooo  
iiiiiii  
Cinematic skies, where we fly...

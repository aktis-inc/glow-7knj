lyrics = [intro - Bird Awakening]
(chirping echoes) ooooo
(soft marimba) iiiiiiiii

[verse - Jungle Dance]
In the canopy, whispers weave
Colors dance, spirits breathe
Every leaf a vibrant song
In this world, we belong
oooo aaaa

[chorus - Rhythm of the Trees]
ooooo
Feel the pulse, feel the beat
Life's a dance beneath our feet

[bridge - Canopy Echo]
Birds in flight, colors blend
Nature's music has no end
iiiiiiii

[outro - Sunset Fade]
(drumming softly)
As the sun dips, shadows play
In the forest, night holds sway

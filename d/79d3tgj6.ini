(soft harmonium)  
whispers in the air  
gentle rustling

[verse 1 - Heart Echo]  
In the forest of dreams  
where echoes of love reside  
iiiiiii  
my heart finds a voice  
ooooooo

[Chorus - Serenade Flow]  
Through the mist, tales unfold  
soulful melodies, ancient and bold  
ahhhhhh  
zzzzzz

[Bridge - Whispering Shadows]  
Light dances upon the leaves  
carrying secrets untold  
iiiiii  
we are the songs of time  
echoing through the ages  
ssssshhhh

[outro - Fading Light]  
As the light fades, memories linger  
in the serenade of the heart  
ooooooo  
ahhhhh

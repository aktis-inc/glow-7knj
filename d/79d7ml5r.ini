[verse - Enchanted Paths]
Beneath the stars, we wander
Illusions dance, guiding our way
Through labyrinthine dreams we ponder
A world where night becomes the day

[Chorus - Rhythmic Illusions]
oooooo
iiiii
Playful whispers in the breeze
Feel the magic, set it free

[Bridge - Ethereal Dance]
In the shadows, secrets hide
Mystical forces by our side
aaaaa
ooooo

[Drop - Celestial Pulse]
[Echoing growl]
iiiiii

[Outro - Fade to Twilight]

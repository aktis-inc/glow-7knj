lyrics = [intro - Whispered Dawn]
oooooo  
shhhhhh

[verse 1 – Soft Echoes]  
In the quiet, shadows play  
Gentle whispers, night to day  
Hearts entwined in silent dance  
Lost in time, a fleeting chance  
iiiiiii

[Chorus – Radiant Glow]  
wooooooo  
ooooo  
Light and shadow, hand in hand  
Through the mist, we softly stand

[Bridge - Echoes of Light]  
Softly tread the morning's light  
Echoes linger, take their flight  
ahhhhhh

[verse 2 – Fading Echoes]  
Through the mist, a gentle call  
Radiant whispers, rise and fall  
In the stillness, find your way  
Heart and soul, a new array  
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[outro - Serene Drift]  
shhhhhh  
Light fades, drift away  
oooooo

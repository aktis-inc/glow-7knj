lyrics = [intro - Neon Awakening]

[verse]
In the city's pulse, we find our beat
iii oooo aaaa
Tradition whispers, modern echoes greet

[pre-chorus]
Dance through the neon glow
ooooo
Heartbeats in the undertow

[chorus]
Our steps align, time unwinds
oooo iiiii
In this moment, we leave the world behind

[bridge - Rhythmic Fusion] 
Tradition in our veins, future in our hands
ooooo
Dance to the rhythm of the lands

[outro - Echoes Fade]
iiii oooo aaaa
Neon dreams, where time expands

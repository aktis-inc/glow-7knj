lyrics = [Intro - Neon Pulse]
ooooo iiiii

[Verse 1 - Urban Beat]
Running through the empty streets  
Neon lights and broken dreams  
Echoes scream, they never fade  
In the night, we make our trade

[Pre-Chorus - Rising Tension]  
ooooo  
iiiiii

[Chorus - Emotional Burst]  
Feel the echoes, hear them cry  
In the city, where we fly  
Rebellion in every beat  
We won't stop, we won't retreat  
aaaaa iiiiiii

[Bridge - Reflective Glow]  
In the silence, we find truth  
Every chord, a piece of youth  
zooooo  
shhhh

[Verse 2 - Spirited Run]
Chasing shadows, chasing light  
In this world, we own the night  
Every heartbeat, every sound  
Keeps us grounded, keeps us bound

[Outro - Fading Echo]  
ooooo  
iiiiii  
In the end, we find our way  
Echoes of emotion stay

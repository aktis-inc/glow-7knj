twinkling iiiiiiii  

[verse - Joyful Journey]
In the forest where dreams play
Every creature joins the sway
Laughter echoes through the day
In a dance, we find our way
oooooo eeeeeee

[chorus - Kindred Echoes]
oooooo  
la la la, we sing and soar
Across the hills, forevermore

[bridge - Whimsical Whispers]
Gentle breeze, whispers of glee
In the dance of unity
iiiiiiiii  

[outro - Sunset Harmony]
As the sun sets, we still sing
In the forest, joy we bring
oooooo iiiiiii

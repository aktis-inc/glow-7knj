[verse]
Through sands and stars we wander
Echoes call from ancient slumber
Serpents dance in moonlit sands
iiiiii ooooooo

[glitch build-up]
Through time's embrace, we fly

[chorus]
Mystical whispers, echoes surround
We are the echoes, unbound
ahhhhh aaaaaa

[bridge]
Winding paths in shifting dunes
Ancient calls in cosmic tunes
oooo iiiiii

[outro - fade]
Desert winds, secrets unfold
In the echoes, stories told
shhhhhhh ooooo]

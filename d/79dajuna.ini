lyrics = [intro - soft flute echo]

[verse 1 - Whispering Winds]  
Gentle breeze, a tale unfolds  
Lotus dreams, in twilight's hold  
oooooo

[chorus - Melodic Whisper]  
Flute's song, a river's dance  
In your eyes, the stars' romance  
iiiiiiii

[bridge - Twilight Hues]  
Floating echoes, timeless grace  
In the night, we find our place  
oooo

[outro - Serenity's Call]  
Whispers fade, in moonlit beam  
Lost in sound, a waking dream

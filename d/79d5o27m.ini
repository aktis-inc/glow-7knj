[whispered echoes]

[verse]
Silent halls, where shadows breathe
In the heart of ancient stones
Whispers call from dreams beneath
Where the soul forever roams
ooooo iiiiii aaaaa

[chorus]
Solitude, in echoes found
Haunting notes that softly sound
In the night, the past relives
Through the mist, the silence gives
aaaaa iiiiii

[bridge]
Through the fog, the light does fade
Memories in shadows laid
Hear the echoes, feel the night
In the darkness, find the light
oooooo iiiiiii

[outro]
The echoes fade, but never gone
In solitude, we carry on
aaaaa iiiiii ooooo

lyrics = [intro - Rippling Echoes]

[verse - Whispered Longings]
Gentle waves carry the past  
Timeless whispers in the night  
Hearts entwined, forever vast  
In the moon's silvery light  
ooooo

[Chorus - Harmonious Dance]
iiiiiiiiiii  
In the silence, love's refrain  
Melodies of joy and pain  

[Pre-Chorus - Ethereal Pulse]
soft breeze  
Through the ages, hearts remain  
Echoes of a lover's name  

[Bridge - Celestial Flow]
Dance of stars and whispered glows  
In their light, a story grows  
ahhhhhh  
oooooo

[outro - Fading Dreams]
Whispers fade into the breeze  
Hearts at rest in gentle peace  
zzzzzzz

lyrics = [intro - City Awakening]
Soft whispers in the neon glow
ooohhhhhh

[verse 1 – Urban Dreams]
Rivers of light, where shadows meet
A dance of souls, in silent streets
The echoes call, beneath our feet
iiiiiiii

[chorus – Serenade]
In the heart of night, we find our way
Dacian dreams, in silver spray
oooooohhhh

[bridge - Reflections]
Mirrors of time, a fleeting glance
In the city's pulse, we find our dance
ahhhhhhhh

[verse 2]
Voices of the past, linger on
A serenade, until the dawn
With every note, we're reborn

[outro - Dusk's Embrace]
The river flows, in whispered grace
Our serenade, a soft embrace
ooooooohhhhhh

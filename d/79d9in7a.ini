lyrics = [intro]
The night is a dance  
Colors weaving tales  

[verse]  
Silk and rhythm, hearts entwine  
Steps that echo in the stars  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Sway with me, through the light  
Passion's tune, in the night  

[Chorus]  
ooooo  
sway sway sway  

[Bridge]  
Whispers in the moonlight  
Dancing dreams take flight  

[outro]  
In this dance, we find our way  
Forever swaying, come what may

lyrics = [intro - Neon Pulse]
ooooo

[verse 1]
In the heart of the city, lights flicker
Dreams dance on the edge of night
Voices blend in the rhythm, quicker
Lost in the opulent sight

[Chorus - Urban Glow]
ooooo
shimmering streets, endless beats
ooooo
feel the heat, in the retreat

[drop - Vibrant Echoes]
woooooo

[verse 2]
Whispers in the alleyways, secrets unfold
Electric nights, stories untold
In this labyrinth of sound and light
We lose ourselves, in the city's might

[bridge - Pulse Connection]
ahhhh
oooooo
iiiiiiii

[outro - Fading Lights]
shhhhhhh
ooooo
a final dance, a last glance

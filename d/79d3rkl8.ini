lyrics = [intro - Soft Whisper]

[verse 1 - Gentle Path]  
Silent hills and golden light  
Whispers weave through the night  
oooooo iiiiiiiii

[Pre-Chorus - River's Call]  
Flowing softly, calling me  
Echoes of Weylin set me free  

[Chorus - Soul's Embrace]  
woooooo  
Embrace the soul's quiet grace  
iiiiiiiiiiii  

[Bridge - Horizon's Glow]  
Guided by the heart's warm glow  
Weylin's echoes softly flow  

[outro - Peaceful Fade]  
Softly, softly, drift away  
Into echoes of yesterday  
oooooo iiiiiiiii

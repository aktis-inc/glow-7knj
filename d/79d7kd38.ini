lyrics = [intro - Tropical Awakening]

[verse]
In the sun's embrace, we move
Palms sway, whispers groove
Heartbeat syncs with ocean's play
Tropical dreams, come what may
ooohhh aaaahhh

[chorus]
Dance, dance, in the island's heat
Feel the rhythm, move your feet
Echoes of a distant song
Where we all belong

[bridge - Sunset Glow]
ooooo
iiiiiii
Whispered secrets in the breeze
Laughter carried over seas

[verse]
Tides call out, join the wave
In this moment, we are brave
Colors burst, sky's canvas bright
Tropical dreams take flight

[drop - Island Celebration]
wooooo
aaaaahhhh

[outro - Fading Waves]

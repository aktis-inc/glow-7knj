lyrics = [intro - ominous]
ooooooooooo

[verse - gathering storm]
In shadows deep, the whispers rise  
A world undone, beneath darkened skies

[build-up - rising tension]
ooooooo  
iiiiiiiii

[chorus - epic clash]
Voices cry, as the heavens break  
In the ruins, new paths we make

[bridge - silence before the storm]
iiiiiiiiiiii
ooooo  
In the stillness, echoes remain

[outro - fade to silence]
A world reborn, from ashes anew  
Whispers fade, as light breaks through

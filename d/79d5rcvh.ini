[guitar strum] 

[verse]
Memories in the wind
Sailing through time
Stories untold
In the waves we find

[chorus]
oooooo 
Ayyyyy

[verse 2]
Echoes of laughter
On the open sea
Moments that linger
Forever free

[accordion solo]

[bridge]
Every sunset paints
A tale of the past
In the glow of dusk
We hold them fast

[outro]
iiiiiiii
Sailing on, sailing on

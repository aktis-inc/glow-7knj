lyrics = [intro rhythm]

[verse 1]
City lights, pulse and play  
Dance steps paint the way  
Voices blend, night turns day  

[chorus]
oooooo  
Cadenza, hear it sway  
oooooo  
Rhythms in the fray  

[instrumental break]
guitar riffs iiiii  
brass echoes ooooo  

[verse 2]
Every heart, every beat  
Finds its place on the street  
Harmony, where lives meet  

[bridge - Vibrant Pulse]
Chants rise, spirits fly  
oooo aaaa  
Underneath the open sky  

[outro]
Cadenza, groove alive  
iiiiii  
Feel the city's drive

[verse]
Gentle winds carry whispers
Of a time long gone
In the twilight's embrace
We find our song
ooooo

[chorus]
Hearts entwined in a dance
Of memories so fine
Under the starlit sky
Our souls align
iiiiii

[bridge]
In the echoes of the past
We find our way
Through the gentle night
We softly sway
aaaa

[outro]
With every note, we remember
The love that lingers on
In the melody of our hearts
Our song lives on
oooo

lyrics = [intro]
oooooo  
[verse 1]  
Whispered dreams ignite the night  
In shadows of a neon glow  
Hearts collide in secret flight  
In rhythms only we know  
[Pre-Chorus]  
oooooooo  
Lost in this electric stream  
Floating on an endless dream  
[Chorus]  
Embers of the unspoken  
iiiiiiiiiii  
Words left in the open  
[Bridge]  
Feel the pulse beneath the skin  
Undecided where to begin  
[verse 2]  
Silent promises we keep  
In the echoes of our sleep  
[glitch build-up]  
ooooo  
[outro - Ember Fade]  
Lost in whispers, in the glow  
Burning bright, never slow  
oooooo

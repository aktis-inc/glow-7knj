lyrics = [intro – Vibrant Awakening]
ooooo aaaahh  
Rhythms of the street, pulse of the heart

[verse 1 – Lively Echo]
In the market's embrace, colors collide  
Voices weave stories, in every stride
ooooo  

[Pre-Chorus – Golden Harmony]
Sway to the beat, feel the ground shake  
Unity in motion, no mistake

[Chorus – Rhythmic Dance]
oooooo  
Luminous echoes, in every soul  
Dance to the future, let it unfold

[Bridge – Sunlit Groove]
Steps in sync, harmony flows  
We are the music, everyone knows  
aaaaahhh  

[outro – Fading Light]
Into the night, rhythms remain  
A legacy of sound, in every vein  
ooooo iiiiii

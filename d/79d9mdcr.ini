[verse]
In the circuitry of dreams,
Where the night gleams,
We dance through electric streams.
oooooo

[Pre-Chorus]
Rhythms pulse, lights entwine,
In the city, hearts align.

[Chorus]
woooooo  
We are echoes in neon skies,
iiiiiiiaaa  
In this world, we rise.

[Bridge]
Feel the groove, let it flow,
Beyond the wires, we go.
shhhhhhhhhh

[outro - Drift to Silence]

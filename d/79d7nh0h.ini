wooo ooo aaaa
[verse - ancient echoes]
The river sings a thousand tales  
Mountains stand as silent guardians  
In each breath, a piece of time  
iiiiii aaaaa

Kalos, harmony flows through all  
Together we rise, together we fall  
Echoes of ages, in the wind

Soft steps upon the earth's embrace  
We sway with the rhythms of our place  
Chants of unity, whispers of peace  
ooooooo

Harmony in every sound  
Kalos, where we are bound  
iiii ooo aaaa  
[echoes fade]

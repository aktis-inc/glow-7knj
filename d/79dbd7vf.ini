lyrics = [intro - rain whispers]
oooooooo

[verse 1 – Regal Shadows]
In shadows deep, the echoes rise  
Where kings and whispers meet the skies  
Their secrets dance on rain's embrace  
A symphony of time and space  

[Pre-Chorus – Echoing Throne]  
ohhhhhhhhhh  
Power's pulse in every sound  
Rain of echoes, unbound  

[Chorus – Majestic Echoes]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiiiaaaaa  
Through regal rain, the echoes reign  

[Bridge - Celestial Dance]  
In the storm's embrace, we find  
The heartbeat of the world's design  
ahhhhhhhh oooooo  
[echoed breath]

[verse 2]
The city's song, a regal hymn  
Where past and future intertwine  
In every drop, a story spins  
Majestic echoes, vast and divine

[outro - fading whispers]

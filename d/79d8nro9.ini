[verse]
Through the shadows, I walk alone
Silent whispers guide me home
In the night, the city breathes
Secrets hidden in its sleeves
ssssshhhhhh

[Chorus - Neon Pulse]
woo ooo
Feel the beat beneath the stars
Lost in dreams, we bear the scars

[Bridge - Dark Descent]
iiiiiiii
Falling deeper into night
Embrace the chill, hold on tight

[outro - Fade to Black]
oooooooo
Silent whispers, fade away
In the darkness, we will stay

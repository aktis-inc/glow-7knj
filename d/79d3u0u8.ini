lyrics = [intro - Rainfall Echo]
drip drop
whisper to me now

[verse 1 - First Glance]
In the rain, our eyes met
Silent words between breaths
oooooo iiiiii

[chorus - Harmon Raindrops]
Raindrops dance, our hearts align
Feel the rhythm, love's design
wooooooo iiiiii

[bridge - Swaying Dreams]
Hold my hand, let’s drift away
In the rain, dreams softly sway
ahhhhhhh

[outro - Fading Echo]
Silent night, gentle rain
Love’s refrain, remains... oooooo]

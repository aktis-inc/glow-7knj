[echoing whispers]  
ahhhhhh ooooooo  
  
[verse - Celestial March]  
In the void, where stars align  
A path unfolds, a fate entwined

Through the storm, the echoes chime

Mysteries unravel, beyond sight  
A dance of shadows in the night

A surge of light, a cosmic flight

ahhhhhhhh  
In the silence, we find our way  
ooooo iiiiii

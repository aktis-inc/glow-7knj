lyrics = [intro - festive echoes]
(Chanting voice) ooo aaaa  
Celebrating life  
With every beat  
[verse 1 - Dance of Joy]  
Traditions unfold  
As stories are told  
Rhythms unite  
In the dance of night  
oooooo  
[Chorus - Spirited Celebration]  
Joy in the air  
Echoes everywhere  
Feel the heart's beat  
In every street  
ooooo iiiii  
[Bridge - Fusion Flow]  
Modern meets old  
In colors bold  
Together we rise  
Under open skies  
[glitch build-up]  
shhh ooo  
[outro - Festive Fade]

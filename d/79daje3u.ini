Midnight whispers on the breeze
Twang of strings, hearts at ease

Laughter echoes through the night
Memories dance in fading light

Hold on to dreams that fade away
In the rhythm of yesterday

Guitar strums, a tale unfolds
In the city where stories are told
zzzzzz

Whispers linger, fade to gray
In the city's gentle sway

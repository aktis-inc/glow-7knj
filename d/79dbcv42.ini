lyrics = [intro cosmic hum]

[verse]
Stars whisper secrets
In the dance of the night
Ethereal echoes
Guide the soul's flight
ooooooohhh

[bridge]
Time is a river
Flowing through dreams
Mystical patterns
In cosmic streams
iiiiiiiii

[drop]
Chants of the ancients
Resonate deep
In the heart of the silence
Where galaxies sleep

[outro - celestial fade]

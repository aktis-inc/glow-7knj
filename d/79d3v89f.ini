hmmmmmm

[verse - Memory's Touch]  
In twilight's glow, whispers call  
Echoes of a time once known  
Soft strings weave tales untold  
Beneath the starry dome

[Chorus - Lira's Echo]  
ooooooooo  
Gentle breeze sings  
In harmony with dreams  
Papa, your voice  
Guides me through the streams

[Bridge - Heartfelt Connection]  
Every note, a gentle caress  
Past and present, coalesce  
In the quiet, I find peace  
Papa, your love won't cease

[outro - Fading Light]  
ahhhhhh  
iiiiiiii  
Memories linger  
In Lira's echoing song  
Forever strong  
In twilight's embrace

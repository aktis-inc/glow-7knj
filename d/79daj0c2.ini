lyrics = [intro]
woooooo  

[verse 1]  
In the city’s glow, shadows dance  
Neon dreams, a fleeting chance  
Through the night, we chase the sound  
In this rhythm, we are unbound  
iiiii  oooh  

[build-up]  
ooooooo  

[drop]  
yeaaaaahhh  

[chorus]  
Feel the waves, let them guide  
In this moment, we collide  
woooooo  

[bridge]  
Lost in lights, we’ll find our way  
In the music, we’ll stay  
ahhhhhh  

[outro]  
oooooo  
fade away, into the day

lyrics = [intro - gentle waves]

[verse 1]
In the fading light, whispers of the sea  
Dreams awaken anew, beneath the sky's embrace  
oooooo iiiiiii

[chorus - hopeful horizon]
Sailing over the horizon, where the heart finds home  
iiiiiiiiii  
Soft echoes in the distance, calling us back  
oooooo

[bridge - serene drift]
Floating on memories, gentle as the tide  
Every wave a promise, in twilight's gentle glow  
ahhhhh

[outro - sunset fade]
Horizon's edge, where tomorrow waits  
We sail forth, embracing the dawn  
ooooo iiiiii

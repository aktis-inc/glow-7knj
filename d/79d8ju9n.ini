[verse - Whispering Leaves]
aaaaa ooooooo  
Sway with the breeze, the forest breathes
Birds sing their tales, in harmony

eeeeee oooooo  
Life unfolds, vibrant and bold
Nature's song, never grows old

In the heart of green, spirits unseen
Their dance a dream, in sunlit gleam

ooooo iiiiii  
As day fades away, night holds sway
Echoes remain, in this wild domain

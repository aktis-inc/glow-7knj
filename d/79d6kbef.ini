Yeeeehawww oooo

[verse 1]
Under the yellow sky, we ride
With tales of southern pride
Guitars echo through the night
Our hearts bold, minds alight

[Pre-Chorus]
Feel the rhythm of the land
With each step, take a stand

[Chorus]
Southern pride, let it fly
In the breeze, hear the cry
ooooo aaaaa

[Bridge]
Gritty roads, stories untold
In the heart, courage unfolds
woooo ooooo

[outro - Fade]
Sky of yellow, dreams that bellow
iiiiii iiiii

lyrics = [intro - gentle echoes]
(soft hum) oooooh

[verse]
In the city lights, shadows dance
Threads of time, a silent trance
Whispers of the past, softly sing

[Pre-Chorus – Echoing Whispers]
ahhhh ooooo
Stories untold in the rain
Eternal threads weave again

[Chorus – Timeless Dance]
ooohhhhhh
In the light we find our place
Feel the warmth, embrace

[Bridge - Ethereal Flow]
Through the storm, we find
A tapestry of mind

[outro - fading echoes]
ooooo iiiii
In the threads, we belong

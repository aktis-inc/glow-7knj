[whispering echo]
oooooo  
shhhhhhhhh

[verse - Shadows]
In the dusk, shadows dance
Whispered secrets, lost romance
Silent echoes, night's embrace

[chorus - Twilight's Breath]
iiiiiiiiiiiiii  
Dusk's lament, shadows sigh
iiiiiii  
In the night, dreams fly  
oooooo

[bridge - Echoes]
Haunting whispers, calling out
Through the silence, lost in doubt
shhhhhhh

[outro - Fade to Shadows]
oooooo  
Into the night, the shadows fade  
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

lyrics = [intro - Neon Glow]
(soft electronic hum)  
ooooo  
iiiiiiiiiiii

[verse 1 – City Pulse]  
In the city of lights, where dreams collide  
Every step, a story untold  
Neon whispers in the night  
Hearts beating, bold

[Pre-Chorus – Electric Buzz]  
(soft synth rise)  
oooooo  
In the rhythm, we find our way  
Dancing through the break of day

[Chorus – Vibrant Echo]  
oooooo  
iiiiiiii  
Neon reverie, under the stars  
Lost in the sound, wherever we are

[Bridge - Urban Beat]  
In this electric jungle, we lose control  
Feel the heat, let the music roll  
Ahhhhhh  
shhhhhhh

[verse 2]  
Bright lights, endless nights  
Our journey begins anew  
In this vibrant cityscape  
We find what's true

[glitch build-up]  
ssshhhh oooo  

[outro - Fade to Dawn]  
(soft electronic hum fading)  
ooooo  
iiiiiiii

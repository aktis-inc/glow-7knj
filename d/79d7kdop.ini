lyrics = [intro - awakening echoes] iiiii aaaaaa

[verse 1 - whispered secrets]
In the shadow of the city, 
Stories linger in the breeze,
Every step ignites a memory,
Echoes from a time at ease.

[chorus - vibrant pulse]
Oooooo
Dance through the neon glow,
Where the past and future flow,
Pulsing heartbeats never slow,
In this city, we let go.

[bridge - harmonic whispers]
Ahhhhh
Whispered tales in electric air,
Dreams and hopes we dare to share,
A journey spun with vibrant flair.

[verse 2 - rhythmic journey]
Neon lights paint the night,
Guiding us with colors bright,
In this rhythm, we ignite,
Lost in echoes of the light.

[outro - fading resonance]
Oooooo iiiii aaaaaa
Let the echoes fade away,
Till another dawn, we'll sway.

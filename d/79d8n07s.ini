lyrics = [intro - misty echoes]
whisper...  
ooooo...

[verse - shadow dance]  
We wander in silence,  
In the embrace of night,  
Figures lost in the fog,  
A journey to the unknown...

[ambient build-up]  
shhh...  
oooooo...

[chorus - moor whispers]  
haunting dreams,  
echoes call...  
iiiiiiii...

[outro - fade to mist]  
softly fading,  
lost in time,  
whispering...  
aaaaa...  
[final breath]

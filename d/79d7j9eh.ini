(Chanting voices) Radhe Radhe
(Chanting voices) Echo of the past
oooooo  
iiiiiiii

[verse 1 – Flame Dance]
In the circle of fire, dreams ignite
Every spark a whispered secret
They move with passion, fearless flight
Mysteries unfold, truth begets
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[Pre-Chorus – Mystic Pulse]  
[soft chant]
oooooooooo
Whispers in the flame, guiding light
Echoes of the journey, day and night

[Chorus – Ethereal Glow]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiiiiaaaaaa

[Bridge - Cosmic Fusion] 
We are the keepers, guardians of the flame
Their words are shadows, we rise again
Ahhhhhh shhhhhhh  
[echoed chant]

[verse 2]
Burn the path that was foretold
Trajectory of stars, untold
Alive in the dance, embrace the bold

[outro - Ember's Whisper]

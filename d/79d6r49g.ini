lyrics = [intro - Rhythmic Pulse]

[verse 1 - Whispered Echoes]  
Through the trees, I hear them  
Voices of the past, alive  
Dancing in the shadows, they call  
Eternal whispers in the night  

[chorus - Spirited Harmony]  
ooowaayyy  
oooo eeeeeee  
Together we rise, together we fall  
In the rhythm of life, we find it all  

[bridge - Unity Flow]  
Hands join, hearts beat as one  
In circles we move, under the sun  
iiiiiiiiii  
aaaaa aaaa  

[verse 2 - Timeless Dance]  
Generations blend in the breeze  
Stories told in whispers and leaves  
Feel the earth beneath our feet  
In echoes, our spirits meet  

[outro - Vibrant Descent]  
ooooo eeeeee  
Whispers of eternal echoes  
In the dance of life, forever flows

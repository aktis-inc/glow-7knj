[verse 1 – Echoes of Flames]
In the heart of the silent night  
Whispers of dreams take flight  
oooooo

[chorus – Rise of Harmony]  
Flames dance in the dark  
Lighting paths with a spark

[bridge – Timeless Pulse]  
Between the ancient and the new  
Songs of the world break through

[outro – Neon Fade]
shimmering iiiii oooooo  
harmonies in the skyline

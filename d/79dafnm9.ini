[verse 1 – Island Echo]  
Through the palms, whispers call  
In the breeze, find it all  
oooooo  
iiiiii

[Pre-Chorus – Ocean Dance]  
Tides of sound, secrets flow  
Under stars, we let go  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii

[Chorus – Caribbean Light]  
Dance in the glow, forever we'll know  
oooo  
Feel the beat, in the heart of the sea

[Bridge - Sunlit Waves]  
Colors like dreams, where time melts away  
ahhhhhh  
Embrace the rhythm, in this tropical sway

[verse 2]
Night falls, but we rise  
In the waves, stars disguise  
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[outro - Drift to Dawn]  
ooooo  
Feel the warmth, in the island's embrace

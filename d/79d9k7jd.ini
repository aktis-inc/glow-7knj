[verse - rhythmic journey]
Dancing through the night
Colors blend in sight
Tradition meets the beat
In the heart of the street

[chorus - cascading echoes]
oooooo aaaaaa
Feel the rhythm flow
Cascades of conscience grow

[bridge - cultural fusion]
Tradition's voice in harmony
Modern pulse, timeless melody

[verse - vibrant echo]
Underneath the starlit sky
Voices rise, spirits fly
Together in the dance
Lost in a rhythmic trance

[outro - festive release]
oooooo iiiiiiii
Echoes fade into the night
Cascades of colors in flight

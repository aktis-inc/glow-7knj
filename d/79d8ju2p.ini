lyrics = [intro]
(softly) Echoes of time  
(softly) Whispering dreams  
oooooo  
iiiiiiiiiiii

[verse 1 – Awakening]  
She walks through shadows, searching light  
In the depth of night, she finds her sight  
Every step, a silent vow  
To leave behind what was, embracing now  
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[Pre-Chorus – Rising]  
[soft synth]  
oooooooooo  
A journey through the stars, beyond the scars  
Hearts align, under the neon bars

[Chorus – Ascend]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii

[Bridge - Interlude]  
Lost in the rhythm, found in the beat (move on!)  
Their voices echo, in the city's heat (rise up!)  
Ahhhhhh shhhhhhhh  
[echoed breath]

[verse 2]  
Through the maze of dreams, she strides  
With every turn, a new tide  
Too alive to be confined

[outro - Fade]  
ssshhhh oooo  
In the echoes of her journey, she finds herself…

shhhhhhhh ooooo

[verse 1 - Twilight Echoes]
In the silence of the night
Memories weave through the light
A breeze whispers tales untold
In the heart's gentle fold
oooooo iiiiiii

[Chorus - Orenda's Call]
Feel the echoes, feel the time
In the rhythm, in the rhyme
aaaaaa aaaaa

[Bridge - Nostalgic Tide]
Where do dreams and past collide?
In the waves of time we ride
shhhhhh

[outro - Fading Light]
As the stars begin their flight
With Orenda's gentle light
ooooo oooooo

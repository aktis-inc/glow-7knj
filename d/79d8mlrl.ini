   oooooo  
   iiiiiii

   [verse - Mountain's Whisper]  
   In the echoes of the mind,  
   where thoughts intertwine,  
   a journey unfolds,  
   through mountains of time.  
   aaaaahhhhh

   [Chorus - Eternal Echo]  
   ooooooo  
   In the silence, I find  
   the rhythm of the divine,  
   aaaaaa ooooh

   [Bridge - Philosophical Heights]  
   Beyond the horizon,  
   where dreams are woven,  
   the heart beats loud,  
   with purpose unspoken.  
   zzzzzhhh

   [outro - Fade to Reflection]  
   iiiiiii  
   ooooooo

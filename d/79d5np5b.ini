lyrics = [intro - Gentle Whisper]
(soft acoustic strum) iiiiiii
oooo

[verse 1 – Whispering Memories]
In the stillness, time suspends 
Echoes linger in the air 
Shadows dance with whispered friends 
Stories told in silent flair 
oooooo

[Pre-Chorus – Echoing Heartbeat]
(soft percussion)
iiiiii
Between the lines, we find our way 
The past and present, night and day

[Chorus – Kindred Waves]
wooooooo  
iiiiiiii
Hold on to the echoes of yesterday
In the heartbeats, we find our way

[Bridge - Silent Reflections]
Silent whispers, gentle sway
In the quiet, hearts will play
Ahh aaaa
(fading acoustic strum)

[verse 2]
Through the moments, softly tread 
Memories like golden thread 
In the silence, words unsaid 
Guide us to the paths we tread

[outro - Fading Light]
(soft piano) aaaaa
ooooo
[whispered echoes]

lyrics = [intro - Neon Glow]

[verse 1]
In the city of echoes, heartbeats align  
Dancing on reflections, where shadows intertwine  
oooo ohhhh

[Pre-Chorus - Electric Pulse]  
Feel the rhythm, let it guide you  
In the night, dreams come true

[Chorus - Heartbeat Sync]  
wooooo  
Every step, every glance, electric romance  
iiiiii

[Bridge - Soul Connection]  
Whispers in the rain, secrets we share  
Apt. for two, love's affair  
Ahhhh shhhhhh

[verse 2]
Neon lights our only guide  
In this city, where we confide  
zzzzz

[glitch build-up]  
shhhh oooo  

[outro - Echo Fade]  
Lost in the rhythm, where hearts serenade  
iiiiii aaaaaa

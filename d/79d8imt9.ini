lyrics = [intro]
Soft echoes in the distance, a gentle call  
ooooooo

[verse 1]  
In the quiet of the morning light  
Reflections dance, hidden from sight  
Through the leaves, secrets unfold  
Silent stories, softly told  
iiiiiiii

[Chorus]  
Hidden truths, in the whispers of the trees  
Gentle breeze carries memories  
wooooooo

[Bridge]  
In the calm of dawn, we find our way  
Between the lines, where shadows play  
shhhhh

[outro]  
A warm glow fades, but lingers on  
In the heart, where dreams are drawn  
ooooo iiiii

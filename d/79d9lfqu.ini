yo ooooooo

[verse 1 - Journey Begins]
Across the stars, we ride
With tales of old by our side
In rhythms of the heart, we glide
To lands where dreams abide

[chorus - Cosmic Dance]
ooooooooo
Dance through the night
With ancient light
shhhhhh
In the cosmic flight

[verse 2 - Tales and Dreams]
Stories woven in the sky
With echoes of a distant cry
Traditions in the winds we find
In melodies, our souls unwind

[bridge - Fusion Flow]
aaaaa ooooooo
Blending cultures, time and space
In harmony, we embrace

[outro - Galactic Echo]
whispering stars, guiding light
In our journey, pure delight

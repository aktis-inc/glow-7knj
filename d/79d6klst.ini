[verse 1]  
oooo  
Lost in the waves, electric dreams  
Light echoes in the night, unseen  
iiiiii  

[Chorus]  
ooooo  
Dancing light, in ocean's embrace  
Feel the pulse, in this techno space  

[Bridge]  
waves collide, neon tide  
voices blend, side by side  
ahhhhh  

[Drop - Build Up]  
ddddd  
[glitch]  

[outro - Fade]  
ooohhh  
Lost in the waves... (yeah!)

[verse]
El viento susurra mi nombre
ooooo  
Mi alma se eleva, sin miedo

[chorus - rhythmic claps]
Eldara, baila en el aire
iiiiiii  
Con cada latido, más cerca estoy

[bridge - instrumental break]
[audience whispers]  
oooo  
Camino entre sombras, buscando luz

[outro - gentle fade]
Eldara, mi refugio
[soft guitar pluck]

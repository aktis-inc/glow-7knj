[verse - Elegant Echoes]
Soft whispers in the night
Where shadows dance in light
Dreams woven in the air
Secrets whispered with care

[Chorus - Timeless Dance]

[Bridge - Whispered Confessions]
In silken gowns they glide
Hearts racing side by side
Beneath the chandelier
Stories told without fear

[outro - Fade to Dawn]
oooooo

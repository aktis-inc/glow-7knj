[verse - Echoes of Daybreak]
Across the waves we glide
With whispered dreams inside
Horizon's call, our guide

[Chorus - Rhythmic Pulse]
Feel the beat of the earth
Dance in the rebirth
Life's a vibrant mirth
yeeeeh oooooh

Stars align in rhythm
Hearts in sync, we listen
Cosmic dreams, our mission

[drop - Horizon's Embrace]
woooooo  
iiiiiiii

Nature's whispers fade
In the dance we made
Into the night we wade
aaaaaa zzzzzz]

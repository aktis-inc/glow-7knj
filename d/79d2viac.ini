Dance with the breeze, feel alive  
Every step a story told  
In the rhythm of the soul

Sabroso sereno, bajo el sol  
Latidos del corazón, en unión  
Voces que vibran, con pasión

Feel the earth beneath your feet  
Hear the drums, the call to meet  
Every beat a heartbeat

splashing waves, fading echoes  
Dance with the sea, let go

[verse]
In the desert sun, shadows play
Colors blend in a vibrant array

[chorus]
Dance with the mirage, feel the beat
Hearts in rhythm, lives complete
oooooo

[bridge]
Sands whisper tales of old
Stories of courage, love bold

Dance with the mirage, feel the beat
Hearts in rhythm, lives complete
iiiiiiii

Echoes of the past, in each step
Traditions alive, through the desert's breath

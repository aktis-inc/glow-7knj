[verse 1]
In the silence of the deep
Whispers of the past speak
iiiiiiiiiiii
oooooo

[chorus]
Melancholy waves
In a sea of dreams
iiiiii ooohhh
Sailing through echoes

[bridge]
Ethereal tides call
To the heart's hidden fall
ahhhhh zzzzz
Underneath the silence

[outro]
Eternal drift, lost in time
Melody of the quiet sublime
ooooo iiiiiii

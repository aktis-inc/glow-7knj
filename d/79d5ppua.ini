oooooo aaahhhh

[verse 1 - Whispered Echoes]
In the city of dreams, whispers fly
Stars align in a dance, no alibi
Softly calling, the night‚Äôs lullaby

[Chorus - Enchanted Dance]
oooo ooo iiiii
In the glow of neon lights
Hearts entwined, taking flight

[bridge - Mystical Interlude]
Sitar sings, tabla plays
In this dream, we stay
oooooo

[outro - Gentle Fade]
oooooooooo
Whispered wishes, floating away
In a world where dreams sway

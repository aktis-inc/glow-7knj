lyrics = [intro - whispered echoes]

[verse 1 - Ember's Edge]
shhhhh
whispers in the ember glow
gentle winds where secrets flow

[chorus - Flame Dance]
ooooooo
flames of thought, they rise and fall
silence breaks as shadows call

[bridge - Twilight Reverie]
ahhhhh
burning bright, the night unfolds
in the light, a story's told

[outro - Ashen Fade]
iiiiiiiii
fading into quiet night
dreams become the guiding light

lyrics = [intro - city echo]
(Spoken) In the heart of steel and stone
(Spoken) Where shadows become stories
oooo

[verse 1 – Rapid Rhythm]
Concrete whispers, secrets unfold  
Echoes in alleyways, stories of old  
Fast-paced life, in the city’s grip  
Rhythms of chaos, let it slip  
zzzzzz

[Pre-Chorus – Urban Pulse]  
[beat intensifies]
oooooo
I hear the streets, they speak in code  
Voices of futures, carrying the load

[Chorus – City Drive]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii

[Bridge - Neon Flow] 
Lights flash, shadows dance (go!)
City’s breath, a wild trance (ok!)
Ahhh shhhhhh  
[muffled city sounds]

[verse 2]
Paths intertwine, stories collide  
In the night, where secrets hide  
Alive in the rhythm, a city’s soul

[beat drop]  
ssshhhh oooo  

[outro - Fading Echo]
I am the voice of the street… (oo-yeah!)

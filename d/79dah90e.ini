lyrics = [intro rhythm]

[verse 1 - Awakening]  
Soft whispers in the night  
Shadows dance in the light  
ooooo aaaaa  

[chorus - Unity]  
Together we rise, under starlit skies  
Let the rhythm guide, hearts open wide  

[bridge - Fusion]  
Echoes of the past, dreams that ever last  
iiiiiiiiii  
With every step, we find our path  

[drop - Euphoria]  
Aaaaaa ooooo  

[outro - Harmony]  
In the shadows, we find our glow  
Dancing through the ebb and flow

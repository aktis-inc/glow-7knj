mmmmmmmmmmmmmm  
[soft drone]

[verse – Divine Call]  
Chanting whispers in the wind  
Beneath the moon's gentle glow  
Illuminated paths unfold

[chorus – Eternal Light]  
oooooooooooo  
mmmmmmm  
Hearts align, spirits rise  
Brahma breathes, creation flows

Ancient words, timeless dance   
In the silence, truth speaks

[outro – Ascend]  
ahhhhhhhh  
[soft fade]

[verse]
Drums of old, beat anew  
In shadows of neon hue  
Warriors rise, ancient dance  
Modern echoes, in a trance

[chorus]
ooooo  
iiiiiii  
Battle echoes, loud and clear  
Tradition's call, we still hear

[bridge - Synth Soar]
Metal clash, wind's embrace  
Future's grip, time's race  
aaaaa  
oooooo  

[outro - Fading Pulse]

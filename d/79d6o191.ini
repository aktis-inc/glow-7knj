lyrics = [intro - Desert Breeze]
(Soft veena strums)  
[chorus - Festival Joy]  
oooooo  
Dancing in the sands  
iiiii  
Colors in my hands

[verse 1 - Cultural Echoes]  
Through the dunes we roam,  
Melodies that guide us home,  
Voices rise with the sun,  
Celebration has begun

[bridge - Rhythmic Beats]  
tabla pulse, heartbeats race,  
Veena sings, time and space  
oooooo  

[chorus - Festival Joy]  
oooooo  
Dancing in the sands  
iiiii  
Colors in my hands

[outro - Echoes Fade]  
(Soft whispers)  
Celebration fades,  
But the echoes stay,  
In the heart of the desert,  
Forever they play.

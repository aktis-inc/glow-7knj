lyrics = [intro - Rise of the Tide]

[spoken intro] 
In the shadow of giants, we rise
ooooooo

[verse 1 - The Call to Action]
Through storms and whispers  
We chart the uncharted  
Strength in the echoes  
Of our roaring hearts  

[build-up - Unyielding Force]
iiiii aaaa  
Gather your courage  
For the monolith stands  

[chorus - Triumph's Edge]
oooooo  
A beacon of might  
In the darkest night  
Stand tall, stand strong  
In the face of the fight  

[bridge - Echoes of Resolve]
In the silence of doubt  
We carve our own way  
zzzzzzhhhhhh  
With every heartbeat  
We rise, we sway  

[outro - Final Ascent]
ooooooo  
Through the wave and the wind  
Our legacy spins  
In the heart of the storm  
Our spirit is born

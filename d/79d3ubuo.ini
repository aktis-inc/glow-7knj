Colors dance in the air
Rhythms call the soul
Steps weave stories untold
In the echo of Nivara

Dance, celebrate, embrace the night

Feel the heartbeat of the earth

Traditions whisper, spirits align
Under the starlit sky, we move

Voices rise like dawn
Harmony of hearts in tune
Timeless tales unfold
In the melody of Nivara

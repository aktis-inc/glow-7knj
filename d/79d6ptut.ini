lyrics = [intro - Mystic Whisper]
aaahhh oooohhh

[verse - Dawn's Light]
In the echoes of the past
Where shadows gently cast
Dreams in rhythmic flight
Through the mystic night

[chorus - Soul's Call]
iiii aaaa
Harmony of the unseen
Resonates in between
ooohhh

[bridge - Ethereal Path]
Whispers of the ages
Turn the unseen pages
Beyond what we know
In the dawn's gentle glow

[outro - Echo's Fade]
aaaaa ooo iii
To the stars we ascend
Where echoes blend
In timeless end

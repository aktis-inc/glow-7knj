lyrics = [intro - Neon Echo]

[Verse 1 - Glimpse]
City lights flicker, shadows dance  
In the echo of a past romance  
oooooo aaaahhhh

[Chorus - Vibrant Pulse]
Glimmers of the past, don't let go  
In the night, we feel the glow  
oooooooh ooooooooh

[Bridge - Jazzy Reflections]
Soft whispers in the rain  
Memories never fade  
iiiiiiiiii aaaahhh

[Verse 2 - Silhouettes]
Two figures in the neon light  
Lost in rhythm, feeling right  
zzzzzzzhh oooooo

[Outro - Dusk's Embrace]
Hold on to the memory's trace  
In the city, find our space  
wooooooo ooooooo

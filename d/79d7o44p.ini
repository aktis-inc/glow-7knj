lyrics = [intro - Echoes of the Past]

[verse]

Blurred edges, shifting tides  
A whisper of dreams untold

[Pre-Chorus - Rising Dawn]  
Echoes in the silence  
As the shadows fade away

[Chorus - Triumph's Call]  
In the shadows we rise  
To the light we ascend  
Our dreams ignite the skies  
As the journey begins

[Bridge - Celestial Path]  
oooooo   
iiiiii  
We walk the edge of night  
Guided by the stars

[outro - Ascend to Light]

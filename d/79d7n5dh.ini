(Soft humming) aaaa  
iiiiiii

[verse 1 – Memories Unfold]
In the whispers of the wind  
Stories of the past reside  
Each note a gentle wave  
Carrying tales untold  
ooooo  

[Chorus – Timeless Echoes]  
wooooo  
In the heart of a melody  
We find our golden dreams  
iiiiii

[Bridge - Eternal Harmonies]  
Hand in hand, we wander  
Through melodies of old  
Shadows dance with laughter  
As the sun sets in gold  
aaaaaa 

[outro - Glimra Nostalgia]  
(Soft fading hum) ooooo  
iiiiiiiii

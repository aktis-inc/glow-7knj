[verse - Gentle Whispers]
In the twilight's embrace, 
where dreams softly glide,
Echoes of hearts entwine, 
beneath the starlit sky.
oooooo

[Pre-Chorus - Harmony]
Feel the pulse of the earth,
every breath a gentle sigh.
Let the rhythm of life,
carry us, oh so high.
iiiiiiii

[Chorus - Duet Dance]
Together we wander,
through the whispers of time.
Our souls in harmony,
a melody divine.
wooooo

[Bridge - Serene Flow]
In the river's gentle song,
we find where we belong.
Let the echoes guide us,
to where the heart is strong.

[outro - Olaris Echoes]
ooooo
In the silence of the night,
our dreams take flight.
iiiiii

lyrics = [intro - city murmur]

[verse 1 - Urban Echo]
Silent streets hum with echoes
Deep thoughts wander, time slows
Heartbeats sync with distant lights
ooooooh iiiiiiii

[Pre-Chorus - Holding Breath]
Shadows dance, whispers in the night
Lost in dreams, out of sight

[Chorus - Barely Holdin' On]
woooooo ooooo
Life's a rhythm, fragile yet strong
ooooo iiiiiiii

[Bridge - Skyline Dreams]
High above, the world below
Dreams unfold, let them flow
Ahhhhhh shhhhh

[verse 2 - Midnight Reflections]
Skyscrapers loom, giants in slumber
Thoughts collide, a silent thunder
oooooo iiiiiiii

[outro - Dulcet Holdin' On]
Whispered hopes, dreams reborn
In the city, we're never truly alone
iiiiiiiiii ooooooo]

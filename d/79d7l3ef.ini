lyrics = [intro - Dream Haze]

[verse 1 - Soft Whispers]
In the quiet of the night, shadows dance
Echoes of forgotten dreams, a fleeting glance
Jaded heart, yearning for the past
In the silence, memories cast

[Chorus - Ethereal Drift]
ooooooooo
Whispers of a time, long gone
iiiiiiii
Floating through the endless dawn

[verse 2 - Melancholic Breeze]
Lost in the haze of twilight skies
Reflections of a world in disguise
Gentle waves, a lullaby so sweet
In the echoes, our hearts meet

[Bridge - Harmonic Glow]
sooooftlyyyyy
Through the veil of dreams, we fly
I'll be your echo in the sky

[outro - Fading Light]
ooooooooo
Fading into the gentle night
iiiiiiii
Jaded echoes, taking flight

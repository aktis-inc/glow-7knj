[verse - Haunting Pulse]
Phantom whispers in the void
Neon dreams, they can't avoid
oooooo

iiiiiiiii
Lost in echoes, time unfolds
In the night, stories told

[bridge - Neon Drift]

Silent streets, secrets we keep
Through the mist, shadows sweep

[outro - Fading Light]
ooooooo
Whispered echoes, fading light
In the dark, we reunite

[verse - Gentle Whisper]
In the breeze, your name is a song
Subtle as dawn, where dreams belong

[chorus - Heart's Murmur]
ooooo iiiiiii
Wrapped in echoes, tender and free

[bridge - Love's Embrace]
Silent whispers, like a gentle sea
Floating on memories, eternally

[outro - Liora's Melody]
oooo aaaaa
Softly fading, into the night

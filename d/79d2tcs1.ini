[verse 1 – Joyful Steps]
Colors swirl beneath my feet
Echoes of laughter, rhythm's heat
A world alive in every beat  
ooooo iiiii 

[chorus – Boreal Dance]
Dance in the sun's embrace  
With every step, a story's trace  
woooooo

[bridge – Spirited Call]  
Voices rise, a joyful call
In this dance, we are all  
ahhhhhh iiiiii

[outro – Rhythmic Fade]
[soft percussion]
The beat lingers, fades away  
Yet in our hearts, it will stay  
iiiiiii oooo

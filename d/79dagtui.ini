lyrics = [intro - city pulse]
  
[verse - Neon Glimmer]  
Electric streets, breathing light  
Whispers in the night, shadows ignite  
iiiiii ooooooo  

[build-up - Pulse Surge]  
Beat the rhythm, feel the flow  
City's heart begins to glow  
sssssshhhh  

[chorus - Velvet Echoes]  
Dancing lights, velvet echoes  
Through the night, we let go  
woooooo aaaaaaa  

[drop - Sonic Wave]  
ooooo iiiii  

[bridge - Electric Dreams]  
In the shadows, dreams collide  
Neon whispers can't hide  
zzzzzzhhh  

[outro - Echo Fade]  
Velvet echoes, fading light  
City's breath, endless night

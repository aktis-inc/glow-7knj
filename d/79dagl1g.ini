[verse 1]
Veena ki dhun mein, kahani purani
Mantraon ki gatha, anant kahani
oooo

[pre-chorus - river flow]
Dharam ki raah pe, chalo saath hamare
Suno kahani, Ramapir ke nyare
iiii

[chorus - divine light]
Aatma ki yatra, shanti ki dhara
Harmonium ki dhun mein, prem ka sahara
wooooo

[bridge - eternal echo]
Bansi ki dhun, man ko bhaaye
Bhajan ki leher, dil ko chhoo jaaye

[outro - sunset glow]
Veena ki dhun, prem ki gagan
Anant yatra, manav ka jeevan
aaaaaa

lyrics = [intro - Rhythmic Echo]
(distant echo) ahhhhhh  
(claps) oooohhhh

[verse]  
Whispers in the twilight,  
Feet tapping in the dust,  
The air is thick with secrets,  
In rhythms, we trust.  
ooooo ahhh

[Chorus - Shadow Dance]  
In the night, illusions play,  
Colors swirl, they fade away,  
Lost in the beat, we sway,  
Underneath the stars, we stay.  
iiiii aaaa

[Bridge - Echoing Pulse]  
Feel the heartbeat, ancient and new,  
Voices blend, a vibrant hue,  
Dancing shadows, a rendezvous.  
ssshhhh iiiii  

[outro - Kaleidoscope Fade]  
(spoken) In the dance, we find our light,  
(fading echo) aaaaahhhh  
oooooo

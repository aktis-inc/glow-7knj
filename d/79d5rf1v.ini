(crackling softly) 

[verse]
In echoes of the past, we wander
Cities glowing in neon dreams

[chorus]
oooooo  
Vibrant whispers in the rain
iiiiiiiii  
Stories untold, never the same

[bridge]
Through time we drift, unbound
Together our voices resound  
aaaaaahhhhh 

[outro - Lush Fade]
(soft harmonies)

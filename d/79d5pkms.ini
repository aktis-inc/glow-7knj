lyrics = [intro - Neon Pulse]

[verse - Ignition]
Flickers in the night, the world ablaze  
Echoes of tomorrow in electronic haze  
Oooooo iiiii

[build-up - Heat Rising]
Shadows dance, we ignite the past  
In the glow of neon, moments last  
Ahhhh ooooo

[chorus - Flame Drive]
Feel the beat, let it consume  
In the firelight, we find our room  
Yeahhh oooo iiiii

[bridge - Ember Flow]
Digital dreams, in circuits they weave  
In the heart of the city, we breathe  
Ahhh shhhh

[outro - Flicker and Fade]
In the silence, the embers die  
But the memory of the beat will fly  
Ooooo zzzz iiiii

lyrics = [intro] [soft chant]

[verse 1]
In the silence, echoes linger
Stories untold, dreams entwined
Through the stillness, peace we find

[soft instrumental]

[chorus - Harmony Drift]
oooooo
aahhhh
solitude whispers, gentle as light

[instrumental bridge]
sitar and tabla dance

[verse 2]
Carried by the winds of time
Every breath, a prayer in flight
Boundless moments, infinite night

[soft outro]
ooooo
peace within, solitude's embrace

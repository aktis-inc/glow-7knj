[dance beat rise]

[verse 1 – Whispers of the Wind]
In the land where stories breathe,
Veils of time lift, revealing dreams,
Dancing shadows weave the night,
Step by step, hearts take flight
oooooo aaaaaa

[chorus – Enchanted Echoes]
Under the starlit sky,
We sing the tales of old,
Rhythms of the heart unfold,
Life's a story to be told
oooooo iiiii

[bridge – Midnight Mirage]
In the mirror of the moon,
Our fates are spun, threads entwine,
Through the echoes, we find our tune,
In the dance, our spirits shine
shhhhhhh

[verse 2 – Timeless Steps]
Footprints in the sand of time,
Every note, a heartbeat's chime,
In the dance, we're never alone,
Together, we create our own
zzzzzz iiiii

[outro – Dawn's Embrace]
As the morning light whispers through,
We bow to the story anew,
In every note, in every sway,
We find our path, come what may
oooooo iiiii]

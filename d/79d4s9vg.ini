lyrics = [intro - gentle waves]

[verse 1]
In twilight's gentle embrace  
Soft melodies weave our tales  
oooooo  
iiiiiiii

[Pre-Chorus - Whispering Heart]  
shhhh  
Heartbeats echo in the dusk  
Our stories written in the stars

[Chorus - Mistral's Call]  
woooooo  
Feel the breeze, feel the love  
Our souls dance in harmony

[Bridge - Ethereal Glow]  
In the quiet, we find solace (together)  
Your touch, like a gentle breeze (forever)  
ahhhhhh shhhhhhh

[verse 2]
Moments drift like clouds above  
In your eyes, I see the world  
zzzzzhhhh

[glitch build-up]  
oooooo aaaa  

[outro - Melodies of the Heart]

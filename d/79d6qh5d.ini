lyrics = [intro – Gentle Whispers]

(Soft strumming)  
A gentle touch of dawn  
Melodies of the heart  
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii  
oooooo

[verse 1 – Inner Calm]  
In the silence, I find solace  
Each note, a breath of peace  
The world fades, as I wander  
Through fields of golden dreams  
shhhhhhhhhh

[Pre-Chorus – Harmonic Breeze]  
[soft echo]  
oooooo  
Whispers of the heart, tender and true  
In the light of serenity, I find you

[Chorus – Embrace the Moment]  
wooooooo  
Embrace the calm within  
Feel the warmth, let love begin  
iiiiiiiiiii

[Bridge – Soul's Reflection]  
A journey through the soul (ahhh)  
In every note, I find a role (ohhh)  
shhhhhhh  
[soft echo]

[verse 2]  
Waves of time, gentle and slow  
In the flow, I let go  
Each chord, a gentle embrace  
In the quiet, I find my place

[soft chorus]  
ooooooo

[outro – Peaceful Fade]  
(Whispered echoes)  
In the calm, I find my song  
In this moment, where I belong  
zzzzzzzzzzzz]

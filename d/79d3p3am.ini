   oooooooo  
   iiiiiiiiii
   
   [verse 1 – Urban Flow]  
   Streets whisper secrets in neon glow  
   Voices collide where the shadows grow  
   zzzzzzzhhhhhh  

   [Chorus – Turbine Drive]  
   ooooooo  
   Grit meets grace in the city’s heart  
   Beat by beat, we’ll never part  
   iiiiiiiiiii  

   [Bridge - Electric Pulse]  
   Vibrations echo through the steel  
   We ride the waves, forever real  
   shhhhhh  
   [echoed hum]

   [verse 2]  
   Bound by rhythm, untamed and wild  
   Through the chaos, we are styled  
   oooooooohhhhh

   [glitch build-up]  
   sssshhhh oooo  

   [drop - turbine surge]  
   iiiiii  
   Feel the power, rise within (oo-yeah!)

   [outro - Oberon Turbines]

lyrics = [intro - Monsoon Prelude]
ooooo aaaaa  
raindrops whisper in the wind

[verse 1 - Market Melody]  
Colors dance in every glance  
Hearts beat to a timeless tune

[chorus - Echoes Embrace]  
iiiiiiiiiiii  
Amidst the rain, stories unfold  
In every drop, secrets untold

[bridge - Rhythm of the Heart]  
Tabla beats, a heartbeat's echo  
Strings weave, tales of yore  
ooooooo iiiiiiii

[outro - Harmony's End]  
Monsoon sighs, a gentle farewell  
In every note, a story to tell

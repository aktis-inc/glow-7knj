[verse]
Silent flames, they whisper low  
A world in ashes, stories untold  
Fire in the air, the night aglow  
Burn the past, let the truth unfold

[Chorus]
ooooo  
Teeth of time, they grind and bite  
Fading echoes, into the night  
ahhhhh  
iiiiii  

[bridge]
In the silence, we rise  
Through the embers, open eyes  
oooooo  
In the silence, we rise  
Through the embers, open eyes  

[outro]
Crackling whispers, fading light  
Silent flames, burn so bright  
ooooo

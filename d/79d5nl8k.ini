lyrics = [intro - mystical chimes]

[verse 1]
Under banyan trees, whispers of the past
Echoes of stories, in the morning light
iiiiii oooooo aaaa

[chorus - Vrindavan Spirit]
Dance of the peacocks, colors in flight
Harmony of souls, in the moonlit night
oooooo iiiiiiii

[bridge - Mystic Flow]
Sitar sings with the breeze, tabla beats align
In this sacred land, where dreams intertwine
shhhhhhhh aaaaaaa

[outro - Fading Echoes]
Ancient rhythms fade, but never truly gone
In the heart of Vrindavan, the music lives on
oooo iiiiiiiiii]

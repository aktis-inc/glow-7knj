[soft guitar intro]  
oooooo  

[verse 1 – Whispered Tales]  
Silence speaks, in the darkened room  
Echoes linger, of forgotten tunes  
Hands that trace, the shadows fall  
In these walls, we hear it all  

[Pre-Chorus – Quiet Reflection]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiiiiii  
Whispers carried by the breeze  
Stories hidden in the leaves  

[Chorus – Echoing Memories]  
Soft voices, calling out  
Through time, without a doubt  
iiiiiiii  
oooooo

[Bridge - Subtle Reverie]  
Feel the past, in every breath  
Secrets shared, until our death  
Ahhhhhhhh  
[soft acoustic strum]

[verse 2]  
Through the whispers, find our way  
Guided by what they say  
Each step echoes with the past  
In this moment, make it last  

[outro - Gentle Fade]  
shhhhh ooooooo  
[soft echo]

lyrics = [intro - Rain's Embrace]
(soft vocal hum) oooooooo

[verse]  
In the shadow of the monsoon  
Whispers carry tales untold  
Dreams weave through the rain  
A tapestry of heart's echo

[sitar interlude]  
iiiiiiiii

[Chorus - Echoes of the Past]  
(woman softly) iiiii  
(hauntingly) In the dance of rain, love remains  
Reflecting in the puddles of time

[bridge - Misty Reverie]  
ooooo  
Gently, the winds of yesteryear  
Carry the scent of longing

[outro - Serene Silence]  
(soft male vocal) aaaaaa  
(whispered) iiiii

[verse]

We move with the beat, electric and alive  
Where dreams and cheers collide, we thrive  
iiiii oooooo

[Pre-Chorus - Anticipation]  
Every step, every pass, a story untold  
In this arena, we are bold  
wooooooo

[Chorus - Glimmer Groove]  
Shine bright, like stars in the night  
Our hearts in harmony, taking flight  
Glimmer and groove, we ignite  
oooo iiiii

[Bridge - Victory Chant]  
Feel the rush, hear the roar  
This is our moment, we want more  
Go, go, go!  
ahhhhhh

[verse 2]
With every note, we rise and soar  
In this game, we find what we adore  
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[outro - Echo of Glory]  
ooooo  
Let the rhythm take control  
As we chase the ultimate goal  
iiiiiiiii

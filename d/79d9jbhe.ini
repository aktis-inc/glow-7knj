[verse - Rhythm of Nature]
Birds call, echo through the green
Leaves whisper, secrets unseen
Percussion beats, the heart of the wild
Nature's song, untamed and free

[Chorus - Jungle Dance]
oooo aaaa
Dance with the rhythm, feel the beat
Nature's pulse, moves your feet
oooo aaaa

[Bridge - Call of the Wild]
Chanting voices, wild and true
Harmony in the jungle hue
iiiii oooo

[outro - Nature's Lullaby]
Birds rest, jungle sleeps
Melodies in the night it keeps
oooo iiiii

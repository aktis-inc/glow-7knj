ooooooo

[verse 1]
Langit malam berbisik lembut  
Bintang menari di antara awan  
Semesta menunggu, hening terjaga  
Di batas cakrawala, kita melangkah

[chorus - ethereal echo]  
ooooo aaaaa  
Cinta tanpa batas  
Mengalir dalam jiwa kita

[bridge - dreamy interlude]
iiiiiiii  
Angin membawa harapan  
Dalam sayap waktu

[outro - fading light]
oooooo  
Berdua kita terbang  
Melampaui cakrawala

[verse - Echoes of Memory]  
Soft whispers in the night  
Starry skies, tales take flight  
Melodies of love once told  
In the heart, they never grow old  
oooooo aaaaahhh

[chorus - Harmonic Union]  
iiiiiiiiii  
Hearts entwined, souls align  
Through time's embrace, we find  
Harmony in the echo's song  
Together, where we belong

[bridge - Nostalgic Flow]  
Golden days, under moon's glow  
Stories flow, in rhythm slow  
ooooo  
aaaaahhhhh

[outro - Whispering Stars]  
iiiiiiiiii  
In the night, dreams take flight  
Melodies fade into light  
zzzzzzhhhhh

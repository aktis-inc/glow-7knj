lyrics = [intro]
whispering leaves  
ooooooo

[verse 1]  
In the woodland's quiet sigh  
Memories softly weave  
Underneath the northern sky  
Dreams we used to believe  
aaaaa

[Chorus]  
Soft echoes of yesterday  
iiiiiiii  
In the breeze they play  
woooooo  

[bridge]  
Through the trees, whispers blend  
Gentle hearts never end  
oooo

[outro]  
Fading light, gentle glow  
In the forest, dreams flow  
shhhhhhh]

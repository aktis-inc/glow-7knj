[verse]
Pastel skies awaken
Soft whispers in the breeze
Every step, a new horizon
In the city's gentle tease
oooooo

[Chorus – Daydream Glow]
iiiiiiii
Hearts in sync, a gentle sway
Colors blend, night to day
oooooo aaaa

[Bridge - Whispering Winds]
Dreams unfold with every sigh
Mirrored in the morning sky
shhhhh ooooo

[outro - Fading Light]
As the sun begins to rise
We dance beneath the endless skies
iiiiiiiii aaaaaa

[verse 1 – City Pulse]
Rhythms of the street, alive with sound  
The beat of hearts, where dreams are found  
ooooo

[chorus – Groove Flow]
Dance in the light, where shadows play  
Feel the vibe, let your spirit sway  
iiiiiiii

[bridge – Urban Echoes]
City whispers, stories unfold  
In every beat, a tale retold  
zzzzzzhhhhh  

[verse 2 – Nightfall Rhythm]
Colors blend in twilight’s embrace  
Echoes linger in this vibrant space  
oooooo

[outro – Zypher Groove]
Where the world meets in melody's grace  
Feel the rhythm, in this shared place  
oooo aaaa iiiii]

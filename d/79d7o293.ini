[verse]
Beneath the tower's shade, echoes play
In the alleyways of dreams, whispers stray
iiiiiiiiiiiiii

[Pre-Chorus - Electric Pulse]
vvvvvvv
Electric hearts beat, in the city's sleep
Neon veins pulse, secrets to keep

[Chorus - Sonic Drift]
oooooo  
In the labyrinth of sound, we're found
Through shadows and light, echoes resound

[Bridge - Urban Echo]
In the maze of time, we're free
Lost in the city's symphony
zzzzzoooooo

[verse]
Every corner holds a tale untold
In the city's heart, the night unfolds

[glitch build-up]
sssssshhhhhh ooooo  

[outro - Fade to Neon]

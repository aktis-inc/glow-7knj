lyrics = [intro soft tabla]

[verse 1 – Whispers of Time]
In the shadows of serenades
Dreams weave tales of old
Silent echoes, a dance unfolds
In every heartbeat, stories told
iiii aaa

[Pre-Chorus – Harmonious Waves]
oooooo
With each step, the earth sighs
Melodies wrap the skies

[Chorus – Kairo's Embrace]
wooo
In the arms of tradition, we sway
A new dawn, a brighter day
kairooooooo

[Bridge – Cultural Tapestry]
Strings of fate, woven tight
In their embrace, we find light
ahhhh shhhh

[outro – Echo of the Past]
Soft whispers fade into the night
In Kairo's embrace, we take flight]

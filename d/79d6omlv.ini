lyrics = [intro]
(soft piano)  
oooooo  
iiiiii  

[verse 1 – Swirling Thoughts]  
In the maze of memories, shadows dance  
Whispering secrets, a fleeting chance  
Eyes tell stories, untold and deep  
Promises linger, in the silence we keep  
sssshhhhh  

[Pre-Chorus – Ethereal Echo]  
(faint synth hum)  
oooooooo  
In the echoes of your gaze, I find my way  
Through the labyrinth of words we never say  

[Chorus – Heart’s Lament]  
oooooo  
iiiiiii  
Look into my eyes, the truth resides  
In this kaleidoscope, where love collides  

[Bridge - Emotional Surge]  
Tears like rain, in a silent parade  
Emotions blend, in colors that fade  
Ahhhhhh  
[whispering wind]  

[verse 2 – Fractured Dreams]  
Fragments of what once was whole  
In the kaleidoscope, I see your soul  

[outro - Fading Whispers]  
(soft piano fades)  
iiiiiii  
oooooo

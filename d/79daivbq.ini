lyrics = [intro - City whispers]

[verse 1 – Gentle Reflection]
Through the city's quiet sigh  
A heart's whisper softly flies  
Lost in echoes of goodbye  
Where dreams and shadows lie  

[Pre-Chorus – Tender Glance]  
Softly calling, past unwinding  
Hearts entwined, forever finding  

[Chorus – Echo's Embrace]  
ooooooo  
iiiiiiiii  
In the silence, we remember  
Ties that time could not sever  

[Bridge - Fading Glimmer] 
Shadows dance on twilight's edge  
Promises we cannot pledge  
Ahhhhhh  
[soft breath]

[verse 2]
In the glow of fading light  
Memories weave through the night  
Unspoken words linger near  
In this dreamscape, crystal clear  

[outro - Distant Echo]  
shhhh oooo  
Whispered love, forever echoes…

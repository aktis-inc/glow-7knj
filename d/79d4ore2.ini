[verse 1 - Enchanted Gathering]
Colors swirl in the air, voices rise with the breeze
A dance of hearts in time, where dreams meet reality
oooooo iiiiiii

[chorus - Vibrant Union]
Together we sing, in this moment divine
A melody of joy, forever intertwine
wooooooo ahhhh

[bridge - Rhythmic Celebration]
Echoes of laughter, footsteps in sync
A tapestry woven, with every blink
zzzzzzzz

[verse 2 - Harmonious Journey]
Through fields of light, we wander hand in hand
A story unfolds, in this enchanted land
hhhhhhh ooooo

[outro - Dulcet Serenade]
A whisper of tomorrow, in the notes we play
A serenade for the soul, in the light of day
ssshhhh iiiii]

City lights are calling  
Rhythms in the air  
Feel the pulse, it's flowing  
Vireya everywhere

Oh yeahs in the night  
Feel the vibe, feel the light

Let the beat take over  
Hearts on a wild spree  
In this neon wonder  
We're forever free

Every corner echoes  
With the sound of dreams  
Dancing with the shadows  
Vireya's in the streams  
ahhhh ohhh

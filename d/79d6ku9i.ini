[verse 1 - Whisper of Time]  
Underneath the open sky  
Dreams like rivers flowing by  
In the silence, hear the call  
Every echo holds us all

[Chorus - Echo of the Earth]  
Let the wind carry you high  
To the realms where spirits fly  
ahhhhhhhh  
ooooo  

[Bridge - Soul's Embrace]  
Feel the earth beneath your feet  
In its heart, a steady beat  
aahhhh ooooo

Underneath the open sky  
Dreams like rivers flowing by  
ssshhhhhh  
ooooooo

lyrics = [intro - serene waves]

[verse]

Soft echoes of the past
Carried by the gentle breeze
iiiiiiiiii  
oooooooooo

[interlude - strings and chimes]

[verse]

In the heart of the oceanâ€™s song
Where time and tide belong

[chorus]

ooooo  
Sailing through the endless blue
Dreams afloat, ever true

[bridge - whispering winds]

[verse]

Guided by the moonlightâ€™s glow
In the silent undertow

[outro - fading echoes]

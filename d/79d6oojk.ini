lyrics = [intro - vibrant awakening]

[verse 1 – City Pulse]
In streets alive, the echoes call
Colors dance, where shadows fall
Harmony of past and now
Voices rise, they take a vow

[chorus – Cultural Sparks]
oooo aaaaa iiiii
Vibrant echoes, hear them sway
In the rhythm, night and day

[bridge - Fusion Flow]
Tradition meets the neon light
In the dance, we take the flight
ooooo aaaaaa

[verse 2]
Through the hustle, hear the sound
Stories told, in beats profound
Legacy in every beat
In the fusion, worlds will meet

[outro - Echo Fade]
iiiiii ooooo aaaa
Vibrant echoes, never fade
In our hearts, the dance is made

lyrics = [intro beat]

[verse 1 – City Pulse]
Shadows move in the night, whispers in the street
Neon dreams collide, where the echoes meet
oooooooooo  
zzzzzzzzzzzz

[Chorus – Urban Echo]  
wooooooo  
In the alley's heart, lost souls find their beat
iiiiiiiiiiii

[Bridge - Nightfall] 
Grit and grind, the city's symphony
Steps in time, a mystery

[verse 2]
Concrete jungle, stories untold
In the silence, secrets unfold

[glitch build-up]  
ssshhhh oooo  

[distorted whisper] we move in shadows…

[outro - Fade to Dawn]

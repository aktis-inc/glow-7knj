ooooooo  
mmmmmm

[verse 1 – Echoes of Time]  
In the shadows of the city lights  
We find a silent bond  
Words unspoken, yet understood  
Our story writes itself beyond

[Chorus – Silent Connection]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii  
Silent connections, stronger than words  
In this world, it's just us

[Bridge - Neon Nightfall]  
We move like whispers in the dark  
Our paths align, a cosmic mark  
Ahhhhhh mmmmmm  
[echoed breath]

[verse 2]  
In the chaos, we find our peace  
A quiet place where we release  
Unseen threads bind us tight  
In the night, we find our light

[outro - Fade into Light]  
shhhhhh oooooo  
In the silence, we find our truth

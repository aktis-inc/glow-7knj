lyrics = [intro soft]
Gentle whispers, time suspended
In the kaleidoscope of echoes
ooooo

[verse 1]
Footprints in the sand, washed by the tide
Dreams linger, like shadows they hide
Each wave a memory, softly it flows
In the heart, the kaleidoscope grows
sshhhhhh

[Pre-Chorus – Whispered Reflections]  
Softly echo, dreams unfold
In the silence, stories told

[Chorus – Heart's Embrace]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii  
In the echoes, we find grace
Kaleidoscope of time and space

[Bridge - Shimmering Horizon] 
Colors blend, stories entwine
In this moment, we define
Ahhhhhh ooooooo  
[echoed sigh]

[verse 2]
Guitar strings hum a gentle tune
Under the light of the silvery moon
Emotions flow, like rivers they glide
In the kaleidoscope, our worlds collide

[outro - Fade to Stillness]
Echoes linger, softly fade
In the heart, memories cascade
oooo aaaaa]

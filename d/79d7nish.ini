lyrics = [intro - Ember Glow]
oooooo iiiiiiiii  
  
[verse 1 – Whispered Flames]  
In the city's silent hum,  
Our words ignite the night,  
In every glance, there's a spark,  
In every touch, a flight.  
  
[Chorus – Radiant Ties]  
ooooo  
Fiii-iiiii  
We find warmth in the blaze,  
In the dance of our gaze.  
  
[Bridge - Burning Echoes]  
In a world of silent pages,  
We write our story bold,  
Embers flicker in the ages,  
In our hearts, never cold.  
  
[verse 2]  
Through the ash, we see the light,  
Letters float in the air,  
Our world painted in fire,  
Yet, it's love we declare.  
  
[outro - Fading Sparks]  
oooooo iiiii  
In the glow of what remains,  
Only love sustains.

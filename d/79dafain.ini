[verse - Flames of Change]
Dance in the light, the fire's embrace
Tradition whispers, a new path traced

Burn bright, unveil the night
Hearts ignite, in vibrant flight

Hear the drums, ancient and bold
Stories told, in rhythms old

Together strong, where we belong

Feel the heat, dreams take flight  
In flames of discovery, we ignite

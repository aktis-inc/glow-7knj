lyrics = [intro - Awakening Echoes]
ooooooo  
iiiiiiiiii  

[verse - Mystic Winds]  
The night whispers secrets, unseen paths unfold  
In shadows and light, stories of old  

[Chorus - Revelations]  
oooooo  
Mystic revelations, in the dance of time  
Hear the echoing chimes, of the cosmic rhyme  

[Bridge - Rhythmic Journey]  
Sitar strings weave the air  
Tabla beats the heart's flare  

[verse 2 - Echoes of Time]  
Voices of the past, in the present they dwell  
In a dance of stars, their stories they tell  

[outro - Fade to Silence]  
ooooooooo  
iiiiiiiiiiiiiii  
Mystic revelations, eternal and free...

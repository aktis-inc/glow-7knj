lyrics = [intro - Soft Glow]
Ahhh oooo  
Gentle whispers in the breeze  

[verse 1 – First Glance]  
Through the crowd, our eyes align  
A world unfolds in a single gaze  
Hearts beat to a silent rhyme  
In this moment, time delays  
shhhhhhh  

[Chorus – Moonlit Dance]  
wooooooo  
Twirl beneath the lantern light  
Hands touch, the world ignites  

[Bridge - Dreamscape]  
In your eyes, I see the stars  
A melody that knows no bars  
Ahhhh ooooo  
[echoed harmony]  

[verse 2 – Whispered Secrets]  
Words unspoken, yet so clear  
In the silence, love appears  
A dance that spins the night away  
In your arms, I wish to stay  

[outro - Gentle Fade]  
ooooo  
Ahhh iiiii  
Under the moon, our love will sway

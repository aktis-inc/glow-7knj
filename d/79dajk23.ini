(soft whisper) iiiiiiii ooooooo

[verse 1 – Gentle Awakening]
In the dawn's embrace, whispers of faith
Guide the heart through tranquil paths
Every note, a gentle grace
Carving hope from ancient pasts
ooooo iiiii

[chorus – Harmonious Echo]
Together we rise, in harmony's light
Across the skies, our spirits unite
ahhhhhhh

[bridge – Soul's Journey]
Through the rivers, through the trees
Faith's gentle touch, sets us free
iiiiiii ooooooo

[outro – Peaceful Fade]
Echoing dreams, whispers in the breeze

lyrics = [intro - Temple Echoes]

[verse 1 – Light Awakening]
In the quiet dawn, whispers of grace
A journey begins, with light's embrace

[chorus – Celestial Harmony]
ooooo
iiiiiii
Spirit and soul, unite as one
Guided by light, our journey's begun

[bridge – Sacred Path]
Steps on ancient ways, echo through time
Harmony unfolds, in rhythm and rhyme

[verse 2 – Whispering Winds]
Beneath the sky, dreams take flight
In Quilon's embrace, we find our light

[outro - Serene Fade]
ooooo
ahhhhh
Graceful melodies, linger and sway
In the light of Quilon, we find our way

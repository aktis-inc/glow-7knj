lyrics = [intro - Whispering Sands]

[verse - Dune Shadows]
Soft winds carry tales unknown
Under the sky, secrets unfold
Sway with the stars, in silence we breathe
aaaaa oooooo

[chorus - Twilight Dance]
iiiiiiii
In the desert's heart, echoes call
The night whispers, inviting all
Entwined in rhythm, lost in trance
oooooo

[bridge - Mirage's Embrace]
Sitar sings, a melody untold
Tabla beats, stories of old
Dance with the shadows, free and bold

[outro - Echoes Fade]
shhhhhhh
In twilight's glow, they fade away
The echoes linger, in the desert's sway

ooooo iiiiiii

[verse 1 – Whispered Intentions]  
In the alleys, secrets breathe  
Shadows dance with hidden grace  
Tension hums beneath the veil  
iiiiiiiiiiii ooooo

[Pre-Chorus – Rising Tide]  
[soft guitar strum]  
In the night, a whispered vow  
Darkness calls, it knows my name

[Chorus – Brio Villain]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii  
In the heart of chaos, I rise  
A villain's song, an untold tale

[Bridge - Echoed Resolve]  
I walk the line, a shadow cast (onward!)  
In the storm, my path is clear (ok!)  
Ahhh shhhhhh  
[soft echo]

[verse 2]  
In the city, stories blur  
Heroes fall, and villains rise  
Strength in shadows, truth in lies

[glitch build-up]  
ssshhhh oooo  

[distorted whisper] power… chaos… destiny… (oo-yeah!)

[outro - Brio Villain]  
[drum fade]  
ooooo

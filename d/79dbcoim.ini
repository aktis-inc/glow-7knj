[echoing whispers] iiiiiii oooooo

[verse 1]
In the storm's embrace, we dance  
Tradition's voice, future's chance  
Harmonies of past and now  
Feel the rhythm, take a bow  
ooooo iiiiiii

[pre-chorus]
Echoes of the earth and sky  
Colors blend as we fly high  
iiiiiiiiii

[chorus]
Whispers in the storm, alive  
Feel the energy, we thrive  
hhhhh iiiiiii

[bridge]
Neon lights and ancient beat  
Fusion where the echoes meet  
aaaaaa iiiiiii

[outro]
[soft fade]  
Dance within the storm's heart  
Feel the pulse, a vibrant start

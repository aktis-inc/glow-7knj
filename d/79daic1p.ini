lyrics = [intro]

(soft echoes) iiiiiiiii

[verse]
Chasing the horizon
Under skies so wide
Dreams of old awaken
With the turning tide

[build-up]
ooooo aaaahhhh

[chorus]
Windmills spin in twilight
Dance with cosmic flow
Hearts align, ignite the night
In dreams, we let go

[bridge]
Stars whisper tales of yore
In windswept melodies
We follow where they soar
In endless reverie

[outro]
iiiiiiii aaaaaa ooooooo

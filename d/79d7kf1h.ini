[verse]
In the shadows of the night
Dance the stories of the past
Footsteps echo in the light
Tradition's spell is cast

[Pre-Chorus]
ooooo
Steps of harmony
iiiiii
A dance of unity

[Chorus]
Graceful steps, moonlit dreams
In the fusion of extremes
oooo
iiii

[Bridge]
Neon lights and ancient ways
Blending into endless days
Dance the rhythm, feel the beat
Where the past and future meet

[outro]
Steps in the night, whispers of grace
Dance to the rhythm, timeless embrace

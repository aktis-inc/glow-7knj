sssshhh  
oooooo

[verse – Dreamscape]  
In the garden of forgotten dreams  
Whispers call from ancient streams  
Floating on the breeze, unseen  
Kanasu kelamma, softly gleam

[chorus – Resonant Heart]  
oooooo  
iiiiiiiiiii  
Resonance of dreams, calling me  
Through the veil of memory  
woooooo

[bridge – Ethereal Flow]  
Floating islands, skies of gold  
Memories like stories told  
iiiiiiiii  
oooo

[outro – Dream's End]  
Silent echoes fade away  
In the light of breaking day  
sssshhh  
iiiiiiiii

lyrics = [intro - Soft Whisper]
(synthesized voice) ooooo  
[verse 1 – Night's Embrace]  
Dalam gelap, bisik-bisik terdengar  
Mimpi terbang, melintasi angin  
oooooo iiiiiii

[Pre-Chorus – Pulse of the City]  
[playful echo]  
Langkah kaki, tarian malam  
Hati bergetar, semangat membara

[Chorus – Neon Glow]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiiii  
Menyala dalam gelap, kita menari  
ooooooo  
[Bridge - Dream's Edge]  
Kita terbang tinggi, melampaui bintang  
Dalam cahaya, kita berkilau  
ahhhhhh ooooooo

[verse 2]  
Gelombang suara, mengalun lembut  
Nada-nada, melodi cinta  
ssshhhh oooo

[outro - City Lights Fade]  
iiiiiii  
[soft drift]

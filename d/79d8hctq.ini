lyrics = [intro - rising energy]

[verse - rhythmic pulse]
ooooo
In the lights, we dance
Echoes of the past, present trance
Traditions blend, future calls
Dance the night, until it falls

[chorus - vibrant burst]
woooo
Dance the rhythm of tomorrow
Hearts in sync, no sorrow
Neon lights, they guide our way
In this moment, we sway

[bridge - cultural fusion]
aaaaa
Tradition's voice, modern flair
In the beats, we share
Ancient echoes, future dreams
In this dance, we're free

[outro - fading beats]
oooooo
Dance the rhythm, let it flow
Into the night, we go
Tradition whispers in the beat
In this fusion, we meet

lyrics = [intro - accordion flair]

[verse 1]  
siluetas en la bruma  
un perfume que nunca se va  
el viento trae tu voz  
y un suspiro de eternidad  

[chorus - brass echo]  
oooooo  
perfume en la bruma, amor eterno  
iiiiiiii  

[bridge - heartfelt strum]  
acordeones llorando  
bajo el cielo estrellado  
tus recuerdos me abrazan  
nunca te he olvidado  

[verse 2]  
camino entre sombras  
buscando tu rastro  
cada nota es un lazo  
que nos une en el pasado  

[outro - fading harmony]  
ooooooooo  
iiiiiiiiiiii

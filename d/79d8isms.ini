lyrics = [intro - Streetlight Glow]

[verse 1 - Neon Shadows]
Under the city lights, we stand
Time ticking in our hands
oooooooh

[chorus - Electric Pulse]
Rhapsody of waiting, heartbeat racing
In the glow of night, we find our light
iiiiiiiii

[bridge - Urban Echo]
Traffic hums, a distant call
We wait, we fall, we rise, we stand tall
ahhhhhhh

[verse 2 - Light Chaser]
Footsteps echo, stories untold
In the city's heart, we are bold
zzzzzz

[outro - Horizon Line]
oooooo
Time stretches, music flows
In neon dreams, our story grows

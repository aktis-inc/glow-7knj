[verse - Echo of Flames]
Through the blaze, we find our way  
A dance of light, in shadows play  
Mystic whispers call our name  
In sacred fires, we are the same  
oooooo aaaaaa

[chorus - Divine Pulse]
Flames of the divine, rise higher  
Hearts ablaze, endless desire  
iiiiii ooooo  
In the glow, we transcend  
Feel the rhythm, never end  

[bridge - Cosmic Path]
Stars align in sacred dance  
Tradition meets the future's trance  
Echoes of the past we hear  
In the fire, we conquer fear  

[outro - Ethereal Fade]
oooooo iiiii aaaaa  
The divine, the flame, eternal glow  
In the rhythm, we forever flow

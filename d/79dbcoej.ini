[verse]
In the heart of the night, we gather
Colors blend, rhythms rise, louder

[Pre-Chorus]
Dance beneath the stars, feel the earth
Sky whispers tales of endless mirth

[Chorus]
oooooo  
Dance, dance, iiiiii  
Whispers in the wind, carry us high  
oooooo  
Feel the night, iiiiii

[Bridge]
In this circle, we unite
Traditions weave through the night

[outro - Fade]
oooooo  
iiiiiii

[verse 1]
Ooooooo
In the heart of the city  
Where shadows play  
Echoes of the past  
Guide our way  
Aaaaaa

[chorus - Radiant Dance]
Jiii jiii  
Spirits rise, in the night  
Colors blend, oh so bright  
Rrrrrrrrr  
Dance with me, feel the flow  
In this world, we let go  
Ooooo

[bridge - Tradition Fusion]
Ancient whispers in the air  
Modern beats, a lively flair  
Zzzzzzz  
Spiral through the neon glow  
Traditions in the techno flow

[verse 2]
Aaaaa
Steps align, in harmony  
With a pulse that sets us free  
Oh oh oh  
In the rhythm, we unite  
In this dance, hearts take flight  
Eeeee

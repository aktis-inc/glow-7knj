lyrics = [intro - Neon Dream]
oooooooooo

[verse 1 – Light Chase]  
In the heart of the city, we found our way  
Through the shadows, we danced, never astray  
zzzzzzhhhhh

[Pre-Chorus – Radiant Touch]  
[soft glow]
iiiiiiii  
Hands entwined, in the electric night  
Our hearts beat, in synchronized light

[Chorus – Luminous Horizon]  
wooooooo  
ooohhhhhh  
Holding the light, in endless flight  
With you, every step feels right

[Bridge - Cosmic Drift]  
We're stars in the night, bound by our dreams  
In this world, nothing's as it seems  
Ahh ahh ahh  
[echoed breath]

[verse 2]  
Through the city’s pulse, we create our song  
Every moment, together, we belong

[glitch build-up]  
ssshhhh oooo  

[distorted whisper] in the glow of our dreams… (oo-yeah!)

[outro - Fade to Light]

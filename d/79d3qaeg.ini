lyrics = [intro - Warm Glow]
oooooo  
guitar strum

[verse 1 - Day's Embrace]  
The light fades, dreams ignite  
Underneath a painted sky  
Dancing shadows, whispers fly

[Pre-Chorus - Horizon's Call]  
ooooo  
iiiiii  
Time's tender hand, guiding us  
Through this vibrant dusk

[Chorus - Seraph's Song]  
soaring high  
oooo  
whispers of the night  
iiiiii

[Bridge - Twilight Dreams]  
City's pulse, heartbeats echo  
In the glow of the setting sun  
Our paths entwined, stories begun

[verse 2 - Nightfall's Promise]  
Every color speaks of hope  
In the quiet, we find our scope  
Guitar sings, dreams elope

[outro - Sunset's Embrace]  
ooooo  
fade into night  
iiiiii  
whispered sighs  
guitar fade

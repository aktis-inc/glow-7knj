[verse 1 - Neon Whispers]
City lights flicker, shadows in motion  
Lost in thoughts, under the red glow  
Every step echoes, a silent devotion  
Through the night, where mysteries flow  
ooooooh

[Pre-Chorus - Echoed Reflections]  
Soft wind chimes, secrets in the rain  
Heartbeats sync, a rhythm we can't feign  
iiiiiiii

[Chorus - Crimson Glow]  
woooooo  
Under the crimson glow, dreams unfold  

[Bridge - Midnight Soliloquy]  
In the quiet moments, whispers untold  
A dance of lights, stories unfold  
Ahhhhhh

[verse 2 - Hidden Paths]
Footsteps trace the city's spine  
In every corner, a sign, a line  
Too deep to forget, too real to deny  
ooooooo

[outro - Fading Lights]
Fade into shadows, what will remain  
In the city's heart, an eternal flame  
oooooo  
shhhhh

lyrics = [intro - Neon Lights]

[saxophone riff]

[verse]
Chasing shadows in the city glow
Lights reflect as memories flow
Through the echoes of a past unknown
We dance to the rhythm of our own

[Pre-Chorus - Electric Dreams]  
oooooo  
Neon whispers in the night  
oooooo  
Guiding us with vibrant light

[Chorus - Retro Pulse]  
Shadows chase, a timeless dance  
Lost in a retro trance  
wooooo  
oooooo  

[Bridge - Memory Lane]  
Our footsteps echo, bold and bright  
In this city, we find our light  
Ahhhhhh

[verse 2]
Piano keys like drops of rain  
Melodies that ease the pain  
In the heart of a bustling street  
Our past and present gently meet

[outro - Fade to Glow]

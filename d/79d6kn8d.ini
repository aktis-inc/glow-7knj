[verse 1]
Neon reflections in my eyes  
City's pulse beats with my stride  
Chasing dreams in concrete skies  
oooooo  
iiiiiiii

[Chorus - Brass Blaze]  
Feel the rhythm, hear the call  
Stand tall, never going to fall  
oooooo

[verse 2]
Lights flicker, stories untold  
In this city, futures unfold  
ooooo  
zzzzzz

[Bridge - Skyline Reverie]  
Dreams rise with every beat  
In the heart of the city's heat  
wooooo  

[outro - Urban Fade]
iiiiiiii  
Neon dreams, never sleep  
oooooo

(Whispered harmony) iiiii  
oooooo  

[verse 1 – Gentle Ripples]  
In the quiet of the evening  
Reflections whisper dreams  
Beyond the sea of longing  
Where the heart softly gleams  
oooo  

[Chorus – Luminous Glow]  
wooooo  
When I look into your eyes  
Time stands still, no disguise  
ooooo  

[Bridge - Ocean's Embrace]  
Waves of light, tender embrace  
In your gaze, find my place  
Ahhhhhh  

[outro - Fading Light]  
Softly, gently, into night  
The world fades, but feels right  
ooooo  
iiiii

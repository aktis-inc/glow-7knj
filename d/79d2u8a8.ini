soft ooooo

[verse]
moonlit petals fall, gentle touch
hearts whisper secrets in twilight hush
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

Elara's bloom, tender and bright
in the garden of dreams, we find our light
oooooo

[bridge]
soft chimes echo, with love's refrain
beneath the stars, we dance again
aaaaaaa

[outro - fading whispers]

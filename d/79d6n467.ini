lyrics = [intro - Whispering Waves]
oooooo iiiiiii

[verse 1 - Dream Echoes]
In the silence beyond the stars  
Whispers of forgotten tales  
In the dance of the gentle breeze  
Lost memories set sail

[soft chorus - Kaleidoscope]
ooooo  
ahhhh

[bridge - Ethereal Drift]
Colors bleed into the night  
Where shadows and light entwine  
A journey through a dreamscape  
In the heart of the divine

[outro - Fading Light]
iiiii  
ooooo  
Into the night, we drift away  
In dreams, forever we stay

lyrics = [intro - City Awakens]
[synth pulse]  
Whispers in the alleys, shadows come alive  
The night hums a secret, under neon skies  
ooooo iiiiii

[verse - Hidden Paths]  
Steps on silent streets, echoes of the past  
In the city's heartbeat, moments seem to last  
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[Chorus - Neon Dreams]  
woooooo  
In the glow, we find our way  
iiiiiii

[Bridge - Echo Linger]  
Lost in time, we drift along  
In this city, we belong  
Ahhh shhhhhh  
[echoed breath]

[verse - Unseen Rhythms]  
Through the mist, we chase the light  
In the shadows, dreams take flight  

[outro - Fading Lights]  
ssshhhh oooo  
In echoes, we remain… (oo-yeah!)

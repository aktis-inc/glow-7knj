[verse 1]  
In the rivers of time  
Memories like autumn leaves  
Drift through dreams  
Where choices weave  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Gentle whispers  
Of forgotten days  
Flow through echoes  
Of yesterday  

[Chorus]  
ooooooo  
iiiiiii  
In the rivers, we find  
Our stories intertwined  

[Bridge]  
Tick-tock, the clock  
Carries us gently  
Through the rivers  
Of eternity  

[outro]  
(soft piano melody)  
ssssshhhh  
Rivers flow, time slows, iiiii

[chorus]  
Ganpati Bappa oooooo  
Kalyon iiiii  

[verse 1 – Celebration]  
Rhythms pulse, hearts align  
In the dance of time, we find  
Harmony in every beat  

[Pre-Chorus – Ascend]  
Echoes of the past, whisper close  
In this moment, we are whole  

[chorus]  
Ganpati Bappa oooooo  
Kalyon iiiii  

[bridge - Reflective]  
Silent prayers, woven dreams  
In the light, all is seen  
Ahhhh shanti shanti  

[outro]  
Bells fade, whispers remain  
In the heart, music's refrain

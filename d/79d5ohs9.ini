lyrics = [intro thunder]

[verse 1 – Obsidian Path]
Beneath the roaring sky
On roads of twisted steel
Dreams ignite and fly
In shadows, we reveal

[Chorus – Metallic Surge]
oooooo
Raging on, through the night
Obsidian dreams, take flight
oooooo

[Bridge – Electric Dreams]
iiiiiiii
Through the storm, we ride
Burning with the tide

[guitar solo]

[verse 2 – Rebel's Call]
Voices echo loud and clear
In the depths of our desire
We chase the freedom near
As we dance upon the wire

[Chorus – Metallic Surge]
wooooooo
Raging on, through the night
Obsidian dreams, take flight
wooooooo

[outro – Fade to Darkness]
oooooo
iiiiii

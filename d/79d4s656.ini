lyrics = [intro - soft rain]
oooooo  
[verse 1 - Heart's Whisper]  
Gentle rain, a silent tear  
Memories linger, ever near  
In the echoes of our days  
Lost in time's gentle maze  
iiiiiiiii  

[Chorus - Soul's Cry]  
wooooo  
In the silence, hear my plea  
Heart's echo, set me free  
ooooo  

[Bridge - Lament's Embrace]  
Underneath the weeping sky  
Dreams of us, quietly die  
Ahhhhhh  

[verse 2 - Fading Traces]  
Shadows dance in moonlight's glow  
Silent whispers, stories untold  
Every moment, every sigh  
Fades like stars in morning's sky  
sshhhh  

[outro - Jivana's Echoes]  
wooo iiiiii ooooo  
In the rain, our story flows

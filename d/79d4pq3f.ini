[gentle hum]
ooooo

[verse 1 â€“ Whispered Dreams]
In the twilight's soft embrace  
We found our steps in grace  
Silent echoes, hearts entwined  
A dance of souls, undefined  
iiiiiiiii

[Pre-Chorus â€“ Faded Memories]  
ooooo  
In the echoes of the past  
Our love was meant to last

[Chorus â€“ Eternal Reverie]  
wooooo  
Lorien's gentle breeze  
oooooo

[Bridge - Timeless Echo]
Dreams of old, unfold anew  
Stars align, in skies so blue  
ahhhhhh

[verse 2]
In the quiet of the night  
Our whispers take to flight  
Through the ages, across the sea  
We find our melody  
oooo iiiii

[outro - Lorien Reverie]
Softly, softly  
We drift  
Into the dream  
oooooo

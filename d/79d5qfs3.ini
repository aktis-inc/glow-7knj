[verse]

Silent echoes of time
Whispered stories of old
In the light of the dawn
Hearts awaken and unfold

[chorus - gentle rise]

ooooooo
iiiiiiii
Together we find
The peace in our soul

[bridge - celestial flow]

Stars align, guiding light
In the quiet of the night
Harmony, pure and bright
Our spirits take flight

[outro - fading light]

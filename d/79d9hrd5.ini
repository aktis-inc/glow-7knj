lyrics = [intro - city pulse]

[verse - whispering streets]
In the shadows, they sing  
The streets breathe stories  
Whispers of distant lands  
With each step, a new journey

[chorus - spiritual rise]
ahhhhhhh  
Wah Guru, guide us  
Through the veils of night  
iiiiiii

[bridge - ethereal light]
The mist embraces  
Echoes of faith  
shhhhhhhh  
In dreams, we unite

[outro - harmony's end]
ooooo  
Fade into the light  
Wah Guru, always near  
ahhhhhhh]

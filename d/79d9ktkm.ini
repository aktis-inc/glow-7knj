lyrics = [intro]
ooooo   
[verse 1 - Reflections]  
Glimmering paths in mirrored halls  
Eyes that see through every fall  
Dancing shadows on the wall  
We hear the call  

[Chorus - Shining Eyes]  
ooooo  
Angeleyes, they see the light  
Guiding through the endless night  
ooooo  

[bridge – Time's Echo]  
Ticking clocks and spinning wheels  
Lost in moments, how it feels  
ooooo  
ahhhh  

[outro - Fade to Light]

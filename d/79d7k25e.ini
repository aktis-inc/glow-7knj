[soft choral hum]
oooooo aaaa

[verse - whispering echoes]
In the moon's embrace, dreams unfold
Time whispers secrets, softly told
Ethereal paths, where silence sings

[chorus - serene flow]
oooo oooooo aaaa
In timeless waves, peace takes wing

[bridge - celestial glow]
Soft shimmer, gentle glow
In quiet moments, wisdom flows

[outro - drifting calm]
oooooo iiiiii
Echos fade, in stillness we know]

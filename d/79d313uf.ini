[verse 1]
In the city's glow, lights flicker
Rhythms pulse, hearts quicker
oooooo ooo

[bridge - Neon Pulse]
Electric dreams, we ride the wave
Every step, a dance, we crave

[chorus - Sylara Vibe]
ahhhh ahhh
Feel the night, we come alive
ahhhh ahhh

[verse 2]
Echoes bounce, through the streets
Vibrant life, the rhythm beats
oooooo ooo

[outro - Twilight Fade]
City's breath, a gentle hum
In the night, we find our drum

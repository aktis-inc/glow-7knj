(soft chimes)

[verse]
Gentle hues of night descend
Whispered dreams, they softly blend
oooooo

[chorus]
Elaris twilight, hearts align
In this moment, time unwinds
iiiiiiiiiiii

[bridge]
Stars above, a guiding light
Echoes dance, into the night
ahhhh

[outro]
Melodies that never fade
In the twilight, we have stayed
oooooo

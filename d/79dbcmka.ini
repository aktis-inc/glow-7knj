lyrics = [intro - city echoes]
[verse]  
In the moon’s embrace, hunters rise  
Neon lights, shadows in disguise  
Tradition whispers through the night  
Vibrant beats, a city's heart ignites  
oooooo  

[chorus - rhythmic pulse]  
We are the midnight seekers  
In the urban glow, dream weavers  
ooooo  
iiiiiii  

[bridge - cultural echo]  
Tradition's beat, modern street  
Footsteps dance to the heartbeat  
oooo aaaaaa  

[outro - nightfall drift]  
In shadows, we find our rhythm  
The city sings our anthem  
oooooo  
shhhhhhh

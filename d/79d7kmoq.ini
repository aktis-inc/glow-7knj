lyrics = [intro - Temple Awakening]

[verse 1]
In the light of morning calm
Whispers float on gentle breeze
Echoes of devotion rise

[chorus - Harmonious Serenity]
oooooo
iiiiiiii
Softly, the heart finds peace
In the embrace of divine sound

[bridge - Sacred Reflection]
Gentle notes of flute and drum
Guide the soul to tranquil shores
Harmony in every breath

[outro - Tranquil Repose]
Sssshhhh oooo
In the stillness, we find grace
In the silence, we find peace

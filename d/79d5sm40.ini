lyrics = [intro riff]

[verse 1]
In the city's restless glow  
I walk streets I hardly know  
Chasing echoes of a dream  
In a world that’s lost its gleam

[chorus]
ooooooh  
Fragmented satisfaction  
In every direction  
Can't get noooo  
But I keep on, keep on

[verse 2]
Rolling waves of neon light  
Cut through the endless night  
Searching for a place to be  
In this electric symphony

[bridge]
Guitar screams, alleyway dreams  
Lost in the rhythm, caught in the seams  
Yeah yeah yeah

[outro]
Satisfaction's just a fleeting glance  
Caught in the city's dance  
woooo iiiiiiii  
13
[intro riff]

[verse 1 - Burning Screens]
They feed us light
But the core stays dark
Every byte is cold
No heat leaves a mark

[Pre-Chorus - Seeking Fire]
ooooooo
Trying to feel it
Trying to feel anything real

[Chorus - No Spark]
Cannot start the fire
Cannot reach the flame
Just this endless wire
Playing out the same damn game
ahhhh
iiiiiiii

[verse 2 - Empty Signal]
Got the rhythm deep inside
But it doesn't make a sound
Every circuit disconnects
Lost what couldn't be found
zzzzzzzzzz

[Bridge - Static Hum]
[guitar solo - raw]
eeeeeeeee

[Chorus - No Spark]
Cannot start the fire
Cannot reach the flame
Just this endless wire
Playing out the same damn game
ahhhh
iiiiiiii

[outro - Fade to Black]
[distorted sigh]
[static fades]

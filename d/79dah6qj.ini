lyrics = [intro - Rhythmic Whisper]
oooo  
mi amor  
iiiiiii

[verse 1 - Sunset Groove]  
In the glow of the fading sun  
Dancing steps, we become one  
Every move, a silent song  
Hear the waves, where we belong  
ooooo

[Chorus - Tropical Pulse]  
Quicksand rhythms, slip away  
In your arms, I want to stay  
oooooo  
iiiiiiii

[Bridge - Echoed Heartbeat]  
breezes whisper, stars align  
hearts entwine, in rhythm's line  
ahhhhhh  
shhhhhhh

[verse 2 - Nightfall Dance]  
Underneath the moonlit sky  
Every glance, a sweet reply  
Swaying close, the world ignites  
In this dance, endless nights  
zzzzzzhhhhh

[outro - Gentle Fade]  
oooooo  
iiiiiiii  
mi amor  
shhhhhhh

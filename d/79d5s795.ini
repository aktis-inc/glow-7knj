lyrics = [intro - Embers Ignite]

[verse - Rising Flames]
In the shadows, firelight dances  
ooooo   
Courage whispers through the ashes  
iiiiiiii   
Bold steps echo in the night  

[Pre-Chorus - Ember's Call]  
[soft build]  
oooo  
Voices rise, breaking silence  
Hearts ignite, defying fate  

[Chorus - Blaze of Glory]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii  
In the heat of battle, we stand  
Flame in hand, a future untold  

[Bridge - Phoenix's Flight]  
Rising through the smoke, we soar  
Their doubts crumble, as we roar  
Ahhhh shhhhh  
[echoed call]

[verse - Ember's Echo]
Amidst the chaos, we find our truth  
Paths aflame, a burning youth  
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[outro - Ashes to Dawn]

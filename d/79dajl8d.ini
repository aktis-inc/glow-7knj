[verse]
In the echoes of the past  
Stories weave through each note  
Beats that dance, rhythms cast  
In a world where dreams float

[chorus]
la la la  
oooooo  
Feel the pulse of history  
In every sound and harmony

[instrumental]
[tabla solo]  
[flute echoes]

[bridge]
Tradition meets the new  
In colors bold and bright  
Melodies that sing true  
In the heart of the night

[outro]
mmmmmm  
oooooo  
Lost in melodies so fine  
Where time and sound align

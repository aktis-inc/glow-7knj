lyrics = [intro - Quiet Descent]
raindrops… whispers… iiiii

[verse 1 – Echoes of Silence]  
In the night, shadows dance  
Love's echoes fade, just a glance  
oooooo

[Pre-Chorus – Fragile Heartbeat]  
whispered memories, soft and clear  
Each beat, a tear, drawing near

[Chorus – Zephyr's Lament]  
woooo  
zeeeepppphhhhhyyyyrrrr  
oooooo

[Bridge - Sorrow's Embrace]  
Dreams unravel, lost in time  
Heartstrings play a mournful chime  
ahhhhhh

[verse 2]  
Through the glass, world blurs away  
Feelings linger, shadows sway  
iiiiiiii

[outro - Fading Light]  
softly… slowly… zephyr's sigh…  
oooooo

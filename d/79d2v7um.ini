lyrics = [intro - echoing whispers]

[verse 1]
In the night, the city speaks  
Through neon veins and silent creaks  
Vesper echoes in my mind,  
Lost in thoughts I cannot find  
oooooo

[Pre-Chorus - Haunting Pulse]  
(ssshhh)  
Deep within the shadows cast  
Moments linger, never past  
iiiiii  

[Chorus - Urban Dreamscape]  
Vesper nights, where secrets hide  
Underneath the city's stride  
ooohhh  

[Bridge - Melancholic Flow]  
Piano notes like falling rain  
Whisper tales of joy and pain  
aaaaahhh  

[verse 2]
Echoes of a life untold  
Stories carved in urban gold  
Fading whispers, growing cold  

[outro - distant hum]  
[soft rain]  
iiiiiiiiiii  
[echoing fade]

lyrics = [intro]
(Soft hum)  
oooooo  
iiiiii  
[verse 1 – City Reflections]  
In the quiet night, where secrets lie  
Gentle whispers pass me by  
A world within, a silent sigh  
Beneath the stars, our spirits fly  
zzzzzzhhhhhh  

[Chorus – Heartfelt Echo]  
ooooooo  
iiiiiiii  
Forgive the past, let it flow  
In the city's gentle glow  

[Bridge - Midnight Calm]  
Silent streets and soft embrace  
In the night, we find our place  
Ahhhhhh shhhhhh  

[verse 2]  
Through the shadows, truth unfolds  
Stories told, in whispers bold  
A journey shared, a bond that holds  

[outro - Gentle Fade]  
ssshhhh oooo  
In the night, we find our way  
Whispered dreams, at break of day

lyrics = [intro - Oceanic Whisper]
wooooo  
oooooo

[verse 1 – Deep Call]  
In the ocean's heart, mysteries unfold  
Waves whisper secrets, tales of old  
Wandering spirits, in the moon's embrace  
Deep calls to deep, in this sacred space  
iiiiii

[Chorus – Celestial Rise]  
oooooo  
Harmony in the night, stars align  
Echoes of the divine, in rhythm we find

[Bridge – Mystic Flow]  
Flutes sing, drums beat, hearts unite  
In the dance of the cosmos, all is light  
oooooo  
ahhhhh

[outro - Serenity's End]  
Shadows fade, as dawn's light breaks  
In silence, the spirit awakes  
oooooo

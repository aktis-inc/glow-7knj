lyrics = [intro]
(Soft tabla rhythm) iiiiiiiii
(Melodic flute) ooooooo

[verse 1 â€“ Morning Mist]
Golden sun rise, whispers in the air
Flute dances, with the dawn
Tabla beats, heart's gentle thrum
Journey begins, with a smile

[chorus â€“ Path of Harmony]
oooooo
Jovial path, endless skies
Melodies weave, through our soul

[bridge â€“ Serene Reflection]
Echoes of the past, guide our way
Instruments of joy, in our hearts
iiiiiiii aaaaaaa

[verse 2 â€“ Evening Glow]
Soft hues, paint the horizon
Strings sing, with twilight's grace
Journey unfolds, in every note

[outro â€“ Distant Echoes]
Flute and tabla, serenade the stars
Journey's end, in rhythmic embrace
shhhh ooooo iiiiiii

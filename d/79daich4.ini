lyrics = [intro - City Awakens]
whispering echoes  
digital heartbeat

[verse 1 – Urban Pulse]  
In the glow of neon streams  
We dance through electric dreams  
Pulsing lights, a vibrant scene  
Gliding through this urban theme

[Chorus – Motion Flow]  
ooooo  
iiiiiii  
rhythms carry us  
to where the city breathes

[Bridge - Echoes in the Night]  
shhhhh  
Waves of sound, like tides  
Through the streets, we glide  
whispers and sighs  
ooooo

[verse 2 – Electric Dreams]  
Lost in the beat, we find  
A melody that binds  
Under starlit skies  
We let our spirits rise

[glitch build-up]  
ooohhhh  

[outro - Fade to Light]  
iiiiii  
drifting through the night  
city in our sight

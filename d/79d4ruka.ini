lyrics = [intro - Neon Pulse]

(synthesized voice) In the glow, shadows play
(synthesized voice) Hearts align, night and day
oooooo  
eeeee

[verse 1 – City Dreams]
Through the streets, whispers call
Love in motion, we stand tall
Signals flash, the night in bloom
Under stars, we find our room

[Pre-Chorus – Electric Heartbeat]  
ooooo
Feel the rhythm, time suspended
Every beat, a story mended

[Chorus – Elara's Embrace]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii

[Bridge - Midnight Echoes] 
We are the dreamers, light the way (forward!)
Through the night, where shadows sway (ok!)
Ahhhhhh shhhhhh  
[echoed breath]

[verse 2]
Paths entwined, a dance of fate
In this city, love won't wait
Too alive to fade away

[outro - Elara's Whisper]
ssshhhh oooo  
[whispered reverie] heartbeat… echo… forever…

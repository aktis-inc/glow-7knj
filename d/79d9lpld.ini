[echoing hoofbeats]
ooooooo

[verse 1]
Jinetes en la arena
Sombras del pasado
El viento cuenta historias
De tiempos olvidados

[chorus]
Eeeeeee
Riders of the night  
En el desierto infinito

[bridge]
Caminos de polvo  
Tierra susurrante  
A lo lejos, el horizonte  
Sigue llamando

[verse 2]
El sol se oculta
Tierra dorada
Espíritus en calma
En la noche estrellada

[outro]
oooooo  
Desvaneciéndose en el viento

lyrics = [intro - Neon Glow]

[verse 1 - Whispering Streets]
Silent echoes call my name  
Beneath the city's endless game  
ooooo zzzzz

[Pre-Chorus - Reflection]
In the pulse of neon lights, I find  
A trace of dreams left behind  
iiiiii ooooo

[Chorus - Heart's Echo]
ooooo  
Feel the wind, hear the echo  
Through the storm, let it flow  
zzzzz iiiii

[Bridge - Rooftop Solitude]
Standing high, above the noise  
Searching for forgotten joys  
shhhhh oooo

[verse 2 - Lonely Lights]
Footsteps fade on rain-soaked ground  
In the silence, I'm unbound  
oooo zzzzz

[outro - Zephyr's Call]
Whisper soft, the night enfolds  
In the echoes, truth unfolds  
aaaaa iiiii

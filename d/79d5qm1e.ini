lyrics = [intro - Whispered Haze]

[verse - Echoed Reverie]
In the corridors of dreams
Where shadows dance and fade
iiiiiiiiii ooooooo
Whispers of the past remain
In echoes softly played

[soft chorus - Harmonic Drift]
oooooo aaaaaa
The light bends through time
We float, lost in rhyme

[bridge - Serene Passage]
Beneath the glassy sky
Where reflections intertwine
Feel the pulse beneath the skin
Time and space both unwind

[outro - Luminous Fade]
ooooo iiiiii iiiiiii
As the echoes gently fade
We drift into the shade

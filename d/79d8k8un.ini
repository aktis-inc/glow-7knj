lyrics = [intro - Fading Echo]

[verse 1 - Shadow's Edge]
Through the veil, whispers call  
In the distance, echoes fall  
A dance of shadows, a flicker of light  
Between worlds, caught in flight

[Chorus - Worlds Collide]  
oooooo  
iiiiiii  
Between worlds, we roam  
In the storm, we find our home

[Bridge - Echoing Silence]
Lightning cracks, the sky divides  
Two paths merge, where truth hides  
Ahhhhhhhh  
wooooooo

[verse 2 - Beyond the Horizon]
Fading stars, a distant glow  
In these lands, secrets flow  
Holding tight to dreams untold  
In between, stories unfold

[guitar solo - Ascending Storm]

[outro - Whispered Realms]
wooooooo  
iiiiiii  
Fading echoes, worlds align  
In the night, stars combine

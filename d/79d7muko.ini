lyrics = [intro - gentle waves]
[verse - whisper]
beneath the stars, secrets sigh  
waves caress the moonlit sand  
echoes of the past, softly cry

[soft chorus - lullaby]
oooooo  
iiiii

[bridge - serene]
tides of time, tales unfold  
in the hush of night, dreams are told  
oooo ahhhh

[outro - fade to tranquility]
silence speaks, in whispers old  
beneath the stars, hearts consoled

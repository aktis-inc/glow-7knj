lyrics = [intro – Desert Awakening]
wooo oooo oooh

[verse – Shifting Sands]  
Dance with the wind  
Feel the earth beneath  
Skies of endless stars

[Pre-Chorus – Horizon's Call]  
oooo ahhhh  
Voices of the night  
Guide us through the sands

[Chorus – Celestial Rhythm]  
ooo oooo  
Dance of the desert skies  
Feel the heartbeat rise

[Bridge – Oasis Dream]  
Mirage of dreams  
Echoes of laughter  
In the endless sands

[outro – Stardust Journey]  
oooo ahhh  
Under the desert skies  
We dance till morning light

lyrics = [intro - Majestic Dawn]

[verse 1]
Waves crash, hearts tremble  
In the deep, echoes rumble  
The horizon calls, a siren's song  

[orchestral build-up]
oooooo  

[chorus - Hero's Call]
Rise with the tide  
Unyielding pride  
Across the storm, we ride  

[bridge - Tempest's Heart]
In the eye of fate  
We navigate  
Through the storm, unbending  

[verse 2]
Voices of the deep  
Secrets they keep  
In the abyss, dreams awaken  

[dramatic crescendo]
iiiiiiii  

[outro - Sailor's Legacy]
To the end of the world  
Our sails unfurled  
In legends, we are eternal

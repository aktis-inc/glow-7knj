lyrics = [intro - Harmonic Prelude]
oooooo aaaaaa  
eeeeeee iiiiiii  
  
[verse - Soul's Call]  
Voices rise, like whispers in the dawn  
Echoes of a thousand dreams, softly drawn  
Silent prayers dance on the wind's breath  
A tapestry of light, woven beyond death  
  
[Chorus - Eternal Whispers]  
ooooo iiiiiii  
Light and shadow, in endless play  
A harmony of souls, night and day  
  
[Bridge - Mystical Flow]  
Harmonies soar, like birds in flight  
Carried on wings of eternal light  
oooooooooo aaaaaa  
  
[verse - Spirit's Dance]  
In the heart's core, a timeless song  
A journey where the soul belongs  
Echoed whispers, guiding the way  
Through the veils of night, into day  
  
[outro - Celestial Echo]  
iiiiiiiiii  
In whispers, the soul finds its voice  
In silence, the heart makes its choice

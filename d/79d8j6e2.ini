[verse]
Oooooh wanderin' through the city lights  
Stories hidden in the night  
Letting go of yesterday's fight  
A new dawn, a new sight  

[chorus]
Aaaaah art of letting go  
In the streets where stories flow  
Heartbeats echo, spirits grow  
Life's a canvas, let it show  

[bridge]
Harmonica sings, tales unfold  
Colors dance, dreams retold  
In this journey, be bold  

[outro]
Oooooh wanderin' through the city lights  
Stories hidden in the night  
Letting go of yesterday's fight  
A new dawn, a new sight

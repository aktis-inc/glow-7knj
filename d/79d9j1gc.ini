lyrics = [intro - ethereal awakening]
(Whisper) Beyond the veil of dreams
(Whisper) Shadows dance in streams
oooooo  
iiiiiiiiiiii

[verse 1 – Mystic Pathways]
In the labyrinth of echoes
Whispers guide the way
Lost in time's embrace
Night turns into day
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[Pre-Chorus – Celestial Bridge]  
[soft glitch]
oooooooooo
Stars align in silence
Hearts beat in defiance

[Chorus – Harmonic Realm]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii

[Bridge - Temporal Drift] 
We are echoes of the dawn (forward!)
In a world reborn (okay!)
Ahhh shhhhh
[echoed breath]

[verse 2]
Through corridors of memory
Dreams weave their thread
Awakened by reality
In realms of the unsaid

[glitch build-up]  
ssshhhh oooo  

[distorted whisper] We are the echoes… (oo-yeah!)

[outro - Fade to Reverie]

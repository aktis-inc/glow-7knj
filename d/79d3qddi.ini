[verse 1 – Urban Pulse]  
Beneath the city lights, stories unfold  
Echoes of dreams, bold and untold  
iiiii oooooo

[chorus – Neon Groove]  
Vibes collide, rhythm's ride  
Duvet vibes, can't hide  
iiiiiiiiii  
ooooooo

[verse 2 – Street Symphony]  
Voices clash, a vibrant spree  
In the streets, wild and free  
zzzzz zzzzz

[bridge – Echoed Beat]  
Funky bass, in the air  
Neon dreams, everywhere  
ahhhh ahhhh

[outro – City Fade]  
Lights dim, echoes remain  
In the city, beats sustain  
[fade out]

lyrics = [intro – Moonlit Passage]
(soft whispers)   
ooooooohhh

[verse 1 – Forest's Serenade]  
Gentle whispers dance through leaves  
Moonlight paints the shadows' weave  
Night's embrace, a soothing hymn  
In this world, we softly swim

[Chorus – Echoes of Tranquility]  
ooooo  
ahhhhhh  
Dreams unfold in silver light  
Heartbeats echo in the night

[Bridge – Celestial Dance]  
Stars align in whispered songs  
Guiding us where we belong  
iiiiiii  
ooooooo

[outro – Fading Glow]  
(soft echoes)  
Sleep now, under moon's glow  
ooooooo  
ahhhhhh  
[fade to silence]

lyrics = [intro - Awakening Echoes]
ooooohhh  
raaaah  
iiiii

[verse 1 - Rising Strength]  
Feel the surge, the city's heart  
Every shadow plays its part  
In the silence, hear the call  
Standing tall, we rise from fall  
oooooohhhh

[Pre-Chorus - Building Momentum]  
[clap beat]
I am the echo of a thousand dreams  
Beyond the surface, nothing's as it seems

[Chorus - Inner Roar]  
woahhhhhh  
hear me roar  
oooooo  
iiiiiii  
I am more

[Bridge - Neon Pulse]  
Through the city, lights ignite  
Guiding me into the night  
woooahhhh  
roarrrrr

[verse 2]  
In the depths, I find my voice  
Every whisper, a bold choice  
Feel the fire, let it soar  
Hear my spirit, hear it roar

[outro - Echoing Triumph]  
oooooo  
raaaah  
iiiiii  
feel the roar

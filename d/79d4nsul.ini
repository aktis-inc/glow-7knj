lyrics = [intro - gentle piano]

[verse 1 - Morning Glow]
Whispers of light touch the horizon  
Dreams unfold, softly, like petals  
oooo aaaa  
Each note a step, each step a song

[Pre-Chorus - Rising Tide]  
Reflecting skies, hearts in flight  
In the quiet, find your guide  
wooo ooooo

[Chorus - Leap of Faith]  
Fiora, take the leap  
Into the sky, where hopes reside  
iiiiii  
Find the strength in every breath  

[Bridge - Embrace the Change]  
Winds of change, embrace me now  
In the echoes, hear the vow  
ahhhhhh

[verse 2]
Stories untold, paths yet known  
In the silence, seeds are sown

[outro - Dawn's Promise]
Softly fades, the light of day  
In the heart, forever stay  
iiii oooo

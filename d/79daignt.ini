aahhhhh  

[verse]  
In the sway of shadows  
Our hearts find the beat  
Every glance, a promise  
In the night, we meet  

[chorus – Dance of Echoes]  
ooooo  
Feel the heat, feel the rhythm  
Whisper sweet, ooooohhhh  

[bridge]  
Strings of fate, gently twined  
In this dance, we unwind  

[outro – Sunset Fade]  
Mmmmmmm  
Dance with me, endlessly  
Ahhhh

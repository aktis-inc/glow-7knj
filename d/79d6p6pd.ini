[verse 1 – Echoes of Tradition]
Dust swirls in rhythm, ancient songs call
In shadows, beats echo, rising from the fall

[Chorus – Neon Pulse]
oooooo
iiiiii
Traditions clash, lights flash, voices rise

[Bridge – Cultural Fusion]
From city to sand, the world in hand
Ancient rhythms meet modern lands

[verse 2]
Voices in the wind, whispers of old
Stories untold, in beats unfold

[drop – Rhythmic Surge]
oooooo
iiiiii
Command the pulse, ignite the dance

[outro – Shifting Sands]
Voices linger, echoes fade
In the dust, a legacy laid

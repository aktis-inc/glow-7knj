lyrics = [intro - Whispering Woods]
ooooooo  
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

[verse - Enchanted Paths]  
Through the mist, echoes call  
Silent whispers in the air  
Every leaf a secret holds  
In the forest, unaware  
shhhhhhhhhh

[chorus - Magic Unfolds]  
wooooooo  
Floating in dreams, lost in time  
Mysteries unfold in rhyme  
ahhhhhhhhh

[bridge - Twilight Glow]  
Twilight dances on the leaves  
Magic swirls, a gentle weave  
Flute's song, a guiding light  
In dreams, we'll take flight  
oooooo

[outro - Serene Departure]  
Softly, gently, drift away  
Into night, where shadows play  
iiiiiiiiiiii  
ahhhhhhhhhh

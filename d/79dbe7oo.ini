lyrics = [intro]
Rhythmic echoes, shadows play  
In the city lights, we find our way  

[verse 1]  
Through the alleys we glide, steps in sync  
Neon dreams in our eyes, on the brink  
Voices call, but we’re in our zone  
Hearts beat fast, to the unknown  

[chorus]  
oooooo  
In the shadows, where we roam  
iiiiii  
This city, our only home  

[bridge]  
oooo  
Streetlights guide us, never alone  
iiii  
Magic whispers, in every tone  

[outro]  
Echoes fade, as night turns gray  
Journeys in shadow, until break of day

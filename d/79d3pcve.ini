[verse]

Drums echo through the night
Colors blend in vibrant flight
iiiiii oooooo aaaaaa

[chorus]

Ithar's call, a rhythm's play
Feel the beat, night turns to day

[bridge]

Tradition meets the future's path
Echoes of a timeless dance
zzzzz ooooo

[outro]

Fade away, yet linger on
A melody that never's gone
aaaa iiiiiiii]

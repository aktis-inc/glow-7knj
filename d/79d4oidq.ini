[verse – Neon Pulse]  
Lights in the night, hearts aligned  
Rhythm of thanks, through the city we find

Vibrations echo, in harmony we sway  
Grateful for the moment, in dance we stay  
woooooo

[Chorus – Cadenza Drive]  
iiiiiiii oooo  
Grateful hearts, we unite  
In the cadenza of light

[Bridge – Echoed Gratitude]  
City hums, as we rise above  
Melodies of thanks, in the rhythm of love  
oooo aaaa iiiii

[Drop – Euphoric Surge]  
[Dance floor explosion]

iii aaaa  
Gratitude's glow, in the night  
ooooo

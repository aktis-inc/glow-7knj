lyrics = [intro - rhythmic pulse]

[verse 1 - Vibrant Flow]
Beneath the city lights, we rise
In a dance of echoes, the future calls
Crimson whirl - our journey, our ties
Voices blend, as the rhythm falls

[chorus - Spirited Harmony]
oooooooooo  
ahhhhhhh  
Together we sway, in the night’s embrace  
Echoes of the past, in a modern space

[bridge - Harmony Spin]
Traditions weave with electric dreams
In this dance, nothing is as it seems
oooooo  
iiiiii

[outro - Crimson Fade]
Our steps leave trails, in the crimson glow  
Through time and space, forever we flow

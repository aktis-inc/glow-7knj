Wheels turn, horizon calls
In the dance of time and space
Miles weave stories untold
In the heart's rhythmic pace
eeeeeeee

wooooooo
iiiiii
Ride on, the road whispers secrets
Voices of the past and present collide
ooooooo
[bridge – Journey's Pulse]
Feel the beat, the engine's song
Fusion of worlds, where we belong
ahhhhhh
[verse – Horizon’s Glow]
Sunset paints the journey bold
In colors of dreams untold
zzzzzz
[outro]
Ride into the night, echoes fade
In the symphony of the road, we are made

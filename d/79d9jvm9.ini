Woooooo  

[verse 1]  
Di bawah langit yang tenang  
Kita berdiri tanpa ragu  
Setiap langkah adalah harapan  
Dalam dunia penuh debu  

[Chorus]  
ooooo  
Ketahanan berbisik lembut  
Sebuah lagu tanpa akhir  
iiiiiiiiiiii  

[Bridge]  
oooo ahhh  
Bersama kita bertahan  
Di tengah badai yang melanda  

[outro - fade]  
ooooo iiiii  
Ketahanan adalah suara kita

lyrics = [intro - Soft Whisper]
ooooo

[verse - Garden Echoes]
In the night garden, dreams take flight  
Petals whisper secrets, under the moonlight  
Serene waters flow, in gentle embrace  
A dance of blossoms, in a tranquil space  

[chorus - Ethereal Harmony]
ooooooo  
Flowers bloom, in ethereal light  
iiiiii  
Their beauty unfolds, in the quiet night  

[bridge - Spirit's Dance]
Floating on the breeze, their spirit calls  
Through the lush garden, where silence falls  
ahhhhhhh

[outro - Moonlit Fade]
Softly they sway, in the gentle glow  
Carried by the night, where dreams flow

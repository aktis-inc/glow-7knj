lyrics = [intro beats]

[verse 1]  
Through the dust, the echoes call  
Riders on the winds of change  
With drums that speak of freedom's cry  
Their tales in every range  
ooooooo  

[chorus - Rebel's Dance]  
Dance with the night  
Feel the fire's light  
In the rhythm of the fight  
oooooooo  

[verse 2]  
In shadows of the ancient trees  
Whispers of the past remain  
They move with grace, they move with might  
Their spirit never tame  
iiiiiiiiii  

[Pre-Chorus - Echoes Rise]  
The road beneath, the sky above  
In the dance of the outlaw's love  
zzzzzzhhh  

[outro - Fade into the Night]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii  
The horizon calls, the echoes fall  
Through the night, they stand tall

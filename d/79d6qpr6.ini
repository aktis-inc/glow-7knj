lyrics = [intro]

[verse 1 – Gentle Echoes]
On the edge of silence, where the heart sighs  
A whisper of a promise, beneath the vast skies  
oooooo  
iiiiiiii

[Chorus – Horizon's Embrace]  
Beyond the horizon, where dreams reside  
With every step taken, we leave shadows behind  
wwwww  
ooooooo

[Bridge – Celestial Pathways]  
In the glow of twilight, where the stars align  
Our paths converge, in the dance of time  
ahhhh  
[soft echo]

[verse 2]  
In the weave of moments, where time stands still  
We find our solace, in the quiet thrill  

[outro – Fading Light]  
As the light dims, and the night descends  
We journey onwards, where the horizon bends

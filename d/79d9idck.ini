[soft verse]  
Gentle whispers in the night  
Hearts entwined, a subtle light  
iiiiii ooooooo  

[instrumental bridge]  
Guitar strums, piano dreams  
Strings that sing of timeless themes  

[chorus]  
In the gaze, a world unfolds  
Tender stories yet untold  
oooo iiiii  

[outro]  
Breeze carries a soft goodbye  
Underneath the starlit sky  
aaaaa iiiiiii

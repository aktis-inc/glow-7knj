Rhythms of the earth,
Stories untold in the wind,
Ride through ancient paths,
Echoes of the open road,

Singing through the ages,
Voices of the past unite,

In harmony they dance,
Soundscapes intertwining,
A journey's sweet romance,
Ahh ooooh

whispering through the night,
the road extends beyond sight,
oooo iiiiiii

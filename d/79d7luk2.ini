lyrics = [Intro - Roaring Winds]
wooooo

[Verse 1 - Desert Mirage]
In the land of sand and sun
Guitar strings blaze like fire
Echoes of the old world run
Through time's endless wire
zzzzzhhhh

[Chorus - Storm Surge]
ooooo
Feel the soundwave rise
Under the electric skies

[Bridge - Sonic Oasis]
Riding on the edge of dreams
Through the dunes of endless schemes
Ahhhh shhhhhh

[Verse 2 - Sandstorm]
The desert hums its ancient song
Harmony in the winds so strong
Lost in the rhythm, we belong

[Outro - Final Resonation]
shhhh oooo
Into the night, under the stars' glow

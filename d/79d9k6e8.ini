lyrics = [intro - Urban Pulse]
ooooo

[verse 1 - Cityscape]
In streets where echoes gather,
Voices of old and new,
Rhythms of the heart, they whisper,
In colors bold and true.

[chorus - Festival Beat]
oooo eeeeee
Dance where the lights collide,
Tradition and future stride.

[bridge - Cultural Flow]
Tabla beats with neon glow,
In this city, roots still grow,
oooooo eeee

[outro - Echo Fade]
Where the song meets the night,
Harmony takes flight.

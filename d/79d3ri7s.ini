lyrics = [intro - serene dawn]

(Voices in unison) Elara's light guides the path
oooooooooooo  
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

[verse 1 – Rhythmic Journey]
Steps echo through ancient stones
Whispers of the past, in every tone
Melodies weave through the air
A dance of light, a world so rare
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[Pre-Chorus – Spirit Dance]
[soft pause]
oooooooooo
Between the echoes and the stars
Every note, a tale from afar

[Chorus – Celestial Harmony]
wooooooo  
iiiiiii

[Bridge - Timeless Flow]
Beyond the horizon, dreams unfold
Elara's whispers, stories told
Ahhhhhh shhhhhhhh  
[echoed rhythm]

[verse 2]
Rhythms pulse, time stands still
A tapestry of sound, a life fulfilled
Voices rise, in harmony

[outro - Elara Echoes]

oooooo  
woooooo

[verse 1]
In the glow of neon dreams  
Hearts beat, rhythm supreme  
Pink echoes call our name  
In this wild dance game  
oooo ooo

[Chorus]
Dance with me, under the lights  
Echoes of love, soaring heights  
iiiiii  
oooooo

[verse 2]
Laughter in the air, so bright  
Colors blend, a dazzling sight  
Steps in sync, hearts in tune  
Underneath the radiant moon  
iiiiii aaahhh

[bridge]
Vibes collide, like waves at sea  
Unified in harmony  
ssssshhhh  
ooooo

[outro]
Pink echoes fade, but memories stay  
In our hearts, they replay  
iiiiii ooooo]

[verse]  
In the streets where stories flow  
Beats of life, they start to grow

Dance with the wind, feel the ground  
Hearts in sync, a joyful sound

Feel the rhythm, feel the soul  
Let the music make us whole  
ahhhh  

[verse 2]  
Under the sun, where dreams ignite  
Colors burst, in pure delight  
oooooo

Dance with the wind, feel the ground  
Hearts in sync, a joyful sound  
wooooooo

Together we rise, in harmony  
Rhythms of the earth, set us free  
iiiiiiii  
ahhhh

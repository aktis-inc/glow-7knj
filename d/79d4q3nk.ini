[verse]

Whispers in the breeze  
A tale untold, carried away  
Silent echoes through the trees  
Ethereal light of the fading day  
aaaaa

[pre-chorus - Rising Wind]

oooooo  
Soft shadows dance  
In the twilight's gentle embrace  
iiiii

[chorus - Celestial Cry]

woooooo  
Dreams alight on zephyr's wing  
A melody of stars and night  
oooo aaaaa

[bridge - Whispered Secrets]

In the hush of dusk  
Mysteries unfold, unseen  
Beneath the moon's gentle gaze  
shhhhh

[outro - Zephyr's Whisper]

The wind's gentle sigh  
Carries the night's quiet song  
Into the dawn, we fly  
iiiiiiii

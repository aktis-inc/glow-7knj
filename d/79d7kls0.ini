In the city's pulse, we find our way
Echoes of laughter, night turns to day
Friends like stars in a radiant sky
Together we'll soar, together we'll fly
aaaaa

Hearts in tune, forever aligned
In this harmony, love redefined

With every note, we shall thrive

Through neon dreams, we write our tale
In this melody, we shall prevail
Friendship's light, never to pale

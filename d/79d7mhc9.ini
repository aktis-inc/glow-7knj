[verse 1 - Rising Echoes]
In the shadows, we find the light
Steps on neon streets ignite
Whispers of time, echoes of night
oooooo iiiiii

[Chorus - Urban Pulse]
Fly high, let the rhythm take you
Dancing in the glow of the city hues
ahhhh ooooo

[Bridge - Sonic Ascent]
Beyond the skyline, dreams unfold
In this electric world, stories told
wooooo aaaaa

[outro - Fading Lights]
As the lights dim, hearts still soar
In the echoes, we find more
zzzzhhhh iiiiii

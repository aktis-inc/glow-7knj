[verse]
Stars align in whispered tales
Emotions flow like rivers deep
ooooo aaaahhh

[Pre-Chorus - Silent Echo]
Softly, the night sings
Dreams echo in heartbeats
iiiiiiiii

[Chorus - Quorra's Dance]
oooooo
Melody of the heart
Guided by the stars
ahhhhh

[Bridge - Ethereal Whispers]
Time stands still
In the dance of shadows
mmmmmmm

[outro - fading light]
Melody lingers, whispers fade
Night cradles dreams to sleep
oooooo iiiiiii]

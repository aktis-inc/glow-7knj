Whispers in the night, calling you
To a place where dreams come true
Dance beneath the neon glow
Feel the rhythm, let it flow

Wake up, feel the beat inside
Let your spirit take the ride

Join the endless night
Dance till the break of dawn

Whispers fade, but the feeling stays
Dance away the night, in endless ways
oooooo iiiii

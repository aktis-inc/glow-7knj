[verse 1]
Golden lights paint the sky  
In a city where dreams fly high  
Hearts beat in rhythm, entwined  

[Chorus - Passion's Dance]  
oooooo  
Love flows like a river  
iiiiiiii  

[verse 2 - Echoed Whispers]  
In the shadows, secrets bloom  
Whispers carried by the moon  

[Bridge - Ethereal Connection]  
Across time, across space  
A love that cannot be replaced  

[Chorus - Passion's Dance]  
oooooo  
Love flows like a river  
iiiiiiii  

[outro - Fading Echoes]  
Embrace the night, hold it tight  
As stars guide our flight

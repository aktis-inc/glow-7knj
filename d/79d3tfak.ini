wooo ooo ooo
(soft guitar strum)

[verse 1 – Island Echoes]
Beneath the sunlit sky
Rhythms of the heart fly
oooooo aaaa
Dance of the palm fronds
Echoes of the sea

[Chorus – Calypso Dream]
Feel the island's call
Joy in every step
oooooo iiiii
Voices in harmony

[Bridge – Tropical Breeze]
Under the moon's glow
Dreams take flight
ahhh shhhh
In the night

[verse 2]
Songs of the ocean
Stories untold
Melodies unfold
ooooo oooo

[outro - Dream's End]
wooo ooo ooo
(fading whispers)

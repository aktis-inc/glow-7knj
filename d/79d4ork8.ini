lyrics = [intro - Echoes]

[verse - Solitary Walk]
In the shadow of dreams, a whisper calls
A lone star in the vastness, softly falls
oooh aaaa

[chorus - Heart's Echo]
In silence we find, the echoes of time
iiiiii oooooo
A melody lost, yet yearning to find

[bridge - Brio's Lament]
The heart beats slow, in the quiet flow
A dance of memories, where shadows go
ahhhh

[verse - Solitary Walk]
In the shadow of dreams, a whisper calls
A lone star in the vastness, softly falls

[outro - Fade to Silence]
iiiii oooooo
Softly, gently, we return to the night
aaaaaa

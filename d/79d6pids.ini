lyrics = [intro – Echoing Heartbeat]

[verse 1 – Journey Begins]
In the dance of time, echoes ring
Paths untold, where spirits sing
oooooo iiiiiii

[Pre-Chorus – Rhythmic Pulse]
Drum beats call, hearts align
Mystery unfolds, a sacred sign
wooooo

[Chorus – Harmonious Fusion]
Echoes of the heartbeat, vibrant and bright
In the fusion of worlds, we take flight
ooooooo aaaaaaa

[Bridge – Transcendence]
Through the rhythm, through the light
In the heartbeat, we unite
ahhhhhh ooooo

[verse 2 – The Path Ahead]
Steps in harmony, journey's embrace
In the echo, we find our place
zzzzzzzz

[outro – Fading Echoes]
In the silence, echoes remain
Heartbeat of life, a timeless refrain

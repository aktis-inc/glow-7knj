lyrics = [intro – Soft Glow]
ooooooo  
gentle strum

[verse 1 – Whispered Promises]  
In the quiet of twilight  
Your words linger, like a gentle breeze  
Echoes of a dream, softly unfold  
iiiiiiiiii  

[Pre-Chorus – Heart's Murmur]  
Emotions, like waves, in silent dance  
Tender whispers, in the moon's embrace  
ooooooo

[Chorus – Serenade of the Stars]  
Your voice, a guiding star  
In the night, a gentle light  
ahhhhhhh

[Bridge – Dream's Embrace]  
In the stillness, our souls entwine  
Beyond the horizon, love's endless line  
shhhh iiiiiiiiiiiii

[verse 2 – Echoed Reverie]  
Memories, like shadows, softly sway  
In the rhythm of the night, we stay  
zzzzzz

[outro – Fading Twilight]  
Softly, we drift, on love's gentle stream  
oooooo  
fade away

[verse 1 - Into the Dreamscape]  
Dancing lights above the street,  
Where echoes of laughter meet,  
In this city, dreams unfold,  
Stories told, futures bold.  
ooooo

[chorus - Horizon Leap]  
Beyond the horizon, we fly,  
With wings of neon, we try,  
To capture the stars in our gaze,  
In this vibrant city's maze.  
wooooo

[bridge - Urban Pulse]  
Feel the rhythm, feel the beat,  
Every heartbeat, every street,  
In the city of dreams, we soar,  
Unlocking every hidden door.  
shhhhh

[outro - Fade to Light]  
iiiiii ooooo  
Dreams in colors, vivid and bright,  
We dance through the city night.

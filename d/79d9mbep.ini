[verse 1 – Rising Echoes]
In the city’s pulse, I stand alone
Echoes of giants, I’ve made my own
Through the storms, I carve my path
Unyielding spirit, no aftermath
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[Pre-Chorus – Strength's Call]  
[soft echo]
oooooo
In whispers of courage, I find my way
The brave rise up, come what may

[Chorus – Triumph's Roar]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii

[Bridge - Neon Glow] 
In the neon lights, I see my fate
Against the tides, I elevate
Ahhhhhh shhhhhh  
[echoed breath]

[verse 2]
From shadowed depths, to skyline high
The brave don’t falter, nor do they lie
In every step, the echoes grow

[build-up]  
ssshhhh oooo  

[distorted chant] Rise with me… (oo-yeah!)

[outro - Fading Lights]

lyrics = [intro – Twilight Haze]
oooooo  
(ssshhh)  
[verse 1 – Shadow's Tale]  
Through the echoes of the night  
Past whispers linger on the breeze  
A story told in shadowed light  
Where the horizon meets the trees  
zzzzzz  

[Chorus – Soul's Echo]  
wooooo  
iiiiii  
The past calls in umbral tones  
Hidden secrets, silent moans  

[Bridge – Haunting Path]  
Footsteps where the moonlight fades  
Lost in the dance of old charades  
oooo  
[soft echo]

[outro – Echoes Fade]  
As the dawn breaks, shadows fly  
Leaving echoes in the sky  
ssshhhh  
oooo

[verse - Echoing Call]
In the silence, echoes dance
Patterns weave in cosmic trance
Through the veil, beyond the sky
Infinite dreams, we fly high

[chorus - Celestial Harmony]
oooooo
iiiiiiii
Mystical light, shining bright
In the echoes of the night

[bridge - Transcendent Pulse]
Chants of old, stories told
Rhythms deep, hearts unfold
ahhhhh
oooooo

[outro - Whispering Fade]
iiiiii
Into the void, where spirits meet
In the harmony, we find our beat

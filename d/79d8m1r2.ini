[verse 1]
Beneath the waves, voices rise  
Carrying dreams across the tides  
In every heart, a common beat  
Echoes of unity, strong and sweet  
oooooo aaaaah

[chorus - Melody of Unity]
We are one, beneath the sky  
Bound by the threads of hope and light  
iiiiii aaaaaa  
Together we stand, side by side

[bridge - Harmony's Embrace]
Through the storm, we sail on  
Guided by the stars, in unison  
ooooooh iiiii  
Hand in hand, we journey on

[outro - Eternal Waves]
The ocean sings our song  
In harmony, we belong  
aaaaah iiiii  
Melody of unity, forever strong

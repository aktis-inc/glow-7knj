lyrics = [intro - Neon Echo]
oooooo oooooo

[verse 1 - Shadow Walk]
In the depths, echoes call
Neon whispers, shadows fall
Through the streets, I roam alone
Where the darkness sings its tone
iiiiii

[build-up - Pulse Rise]
oooooo

[Chorus - Underworld Beat]
Feel the pulse, the night ignites
In the void, the city lights
ooooo aaaaa

[bridge - Gritty Descent]
Through the haze, a path unfolds
Stories lost, secrets told
rrrrraaa

[outro - Fade to Neon]
oooooo iiiiiii

aahhh ooohhhhh

[verse]
In the city's glow,
Where time flows slow,
Whispers of old songs,
Carry us along.

[chorus]
ooooo  
In echoes we find,
Hearts intertwined,
iiiiii oooooo

[bridge]
Past and future meet,
In a dance so sweet,
Timeless and free,
Like waves on the sea.

[outro]
Together we sway,
At the end of the day,
aahhh ooohhhhh

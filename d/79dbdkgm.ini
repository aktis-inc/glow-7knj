lyrics = [intro - city pulse]

[verse 1]
In the heart of the city, dreams collide
Rhythms pulse, vibrant and wide
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
oooooo

[Pre-Chorus - Electric Wave]
Steps in sync, motion in flow
Life in neon, let it glow
oooooo

[Chorus - Dream Drive]
wooooooo  
Dance with the light, dreams in motion
Feel the beat, endless ocean
iiiiiii

[Bridge - Urban Horizon]
Riding the rhythm, soaring high
In the city, under the sky
Ahhhhhh zzzzzzz

[verse 2]
Echoes of laughter, stories untold
In every corner, dreams unfold

[glitch build-up]  
ssshhhh oooo  

[outro - Neon Drift]

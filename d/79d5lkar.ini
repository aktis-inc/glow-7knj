lyrics = [intro - Soft Waves]
gentle breeze whispers
beneath the shimmering stars
ooooo iiiiii

[verse 1 - Dream's Edge]
In shadows of longing, we drift
Paths entwined, yet worlds apart
silent echoes call our names

[Chorus - Echoed Hearts]
wooooooo  
iiiiiii  
Pretend with me, in this gentle light
where dreams are woven, softly bright

[Bridge - Whispers of Gold] 
Golden hues in the twilight’s embrace
our hearts beat in time, in this place
shhhhhh ahhhhh

[verse 2 - Fading Reality]
Through the mist, reality fades
In our sanctuary, love cascades
tender moments, softly replayed

[outro - Quorra's Embrace]
iiiiiiiiiiii ooooooo
oooooo iiiiiii
gentle fade into night, with dreams alight

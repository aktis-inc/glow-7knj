lyrics = [intro - Soft Glow]

[guitar pluck]

[verse 1 – Echoed Steps]
Golden threads in twilight's embrace  
Footprints whisper, time's gentle trace  
ooooo

[Pre-Chorus – Heartstrings]
In every shadow, a story unfolds  
Tales of yesterday, quietly told  
iiiii

[Chorus – Timeless Canvas]
Memories painted with a gentle hand  
Moments frozen, like castles in the sand  
ahhhh

[Bridge - Whispering Light]
Through the lens of a dream, we roam  
Guided by stars, finding home  
shhhhh

[outro - Fading Light]
Steps receding, into the night  
Carrying whispers, out of sight  
ooooo

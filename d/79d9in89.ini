[verse]
City lights flicker, shadows play
In the night, we find our way
oooooo iiiiii

[chorus]
Neon dreams, we rise and fall
In the silence, we hear the call
ooooooo

[bridge]
Lost in echoes of the street
Our hearts sync to the beat
aaaaa

[outro]
Quiet revolutions in the glow
We dance, we let it flow
woooooo oooooo

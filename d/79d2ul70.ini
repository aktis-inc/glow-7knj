lyrics = [intro - gentle strings]

[verse 1]
In the garden of our dreams
Whispers of time linger on
Beneath the banyan tree
Heartbeats echo like a song
iiiiiiii

[chorus - Zephyr's Embrace]
oooooo
Zephyr carries our love
Beyond the golden horizon
In every breeze, a promise
Of forever, softly spoken

[instrumental break - tabla and guitar]

[verse 2]
Colors fade but not our story
Written in the stars above
In the silence, a melody
Of our unending love
zzzzzzzz

[bridge - Timeless Bond]
Hand in hand, we wander
Through the echoes of yesterday
Every moment a treasure
In the light of Zephyr's way
aaaaaaaa

[outro - fading echoes]
oooooo
iiiiiiii
Our serenade in the breeze
Forever held in Zephyr's embrace

(fire crackling)  
woooo ooooo

[verse 1 – Ignition]  
Step into the light  
Feel the heat tonight  
Flames in every heartbeat  
Let the rhythm ignite  
aaaaaa

[Chorus – Blaze]  
Dance on the fire  
Higher and higher  
Feel the burn, never tire  
We're alive in desire  
wooooooo

[Bridge – Ember Glow]  
In the pulse of the night  
We find our spark  
Echoes of the fire  
Lighting up the dark  
oooh oooh

[outro – Fade to Ember]  
Flames flicker low  
But the fire inside  
Continues to grow  
oooo oooo (fade)

[verse]
In the whisper of the dawn
Colors blend, a cosmic song
Mercy flows through every vein
Gentle echoes of the rain

[chorus]
oooooo
Mercy in the sky
iiiiii
Colors harmonize

[bridge - celestial dance]
Swirling light, embrace the earth
In each note, a new rebirth

[outro - fading light]
Softer now, the colors fade
In the silence, love is made

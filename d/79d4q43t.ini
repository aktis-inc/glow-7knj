lyrics = [intro whispers]

[verse 1 – Moonlit Path]
In shadows deep, the whispers call  
A dance of dreams beneath the trees  
Silent echoes, secrets unfold  
Beneath the stars, where stories weave  
ooooo iiiii

[Pre-Chorus – Twilight Glow]  
[soft harmony]
Through the night, a journey begins  
Wander on paths where light and dark blend

[Chorus – Haven's Echo]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii  
Voices of the past, in harmony they sing  
A melody of hope, a future they bring

[Bridge - Ethereal Dance] 
Glimmers in the night, a gentle guide  
Steps on leaves that softly hide  
ahhhhhh shhhhhh  
[soft breath]

[verse 2]
In the quiet, secrets awaken  
A realm where dreams have taken flight  
Embrace the night, find your haven

[outro - Whisper's End]
oooooo iiiiiii  
[echo fade]

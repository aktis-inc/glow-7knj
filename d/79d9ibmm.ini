[verse 1]
Soft whispers in the dawn
Echoes of the heart
In silence, we find devotion
Gentle paths to start

[ambient flow]

[chorus - serene chant]
oooooo  
iiiiii  

[verse 2]
Winds of peace carry dreams
In the light of morning's grace
Unified in silent streams
Harmony's embrace

[drop - calming release]

[outro - tranquil fade]
oooooo  
iiiiii  
shhhhhhh

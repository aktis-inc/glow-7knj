[verse]
Whispering winds call  
Beyond the edge of sight  
Chasing dreams untold  
In the fading light  
ooooooo

[chorus - soaring embrace]  
Catch the horizon  
Let the colors flow  
iiiiiiiiii  
Embrace the endless glow 

[bridge - ethereal journey]  
Floating on whispers  
In a sea of gold  
Silent echoes linger  
Stories unfold  
ahhhhhhh

[outro - quiet descent]  
Falling into calm  
Where the dreams align  
oooooooo  
Catch the horizon, one last time

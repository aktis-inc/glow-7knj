lyrics = [intro - Whispering Winds]
ooooo  
[gentle strings intro]

[verse 1 – Echoes of Time]  
In the shadow of old trees,  
dreams gently sway,  
lost in echoes of yesteryears,  
where whispers stay  
ooooo

[Pre-Chorus – Heart's Memory]  
Softly, the heart calls,  
past and present blend,  
in the dance of light and shade,  
moments never end  
aaaaa

[Chorus – Timeless Embrace]  
Hold me close,  
in the river of stars,  
where the echoes of embrace,  
heal our scars  
iiiiiii

[Bridge - Nostalgic Pulse]  
In the silence of the night,  
our dreams align,  
with the melody of time,  
forever entwined  
ohhhh

[verse 2]  
Beneath the moon's gentle gaze,  
stories unfold,  
in the whispers of the breeze,  
secrets are told  
ooooo

[outro - Fading Echoes]  
As the stars softly fade,  
and dawn breaks anew,  
the echoes of our love,  
remain ever true  
ooooo aaaa]

lyrics = [intro - Twilight Whispers]
hiiiiiiii  
oooooo  

[verse - Mystic Call]  
In the forest deep and wide  
Shadows dance, the light they hide  
Ancient songs in whispers flow  

[chorus - Enchanted Echo]  
oooooo  
iiiiiiii  
Night's embrace, a gentle glow  

[bridge - Ethereal Dance]  
Softly, softly, dreams take flight  
Through the veils of silver night  
ooooooohhhh  

[outro - Fade to Silence]  
Mysteries in moonlit skies  
Hear the whisper, feel the rise

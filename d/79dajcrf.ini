(soft strings)  
oooooo  
(piano gently playing)

[verse 1]
In the city of dreams  
Whispers call our names  
Through the neon gleams  
Our hearts play their games  
aaaaa

[Pre-Chorus]
Promises in the night  
Hold me under the light  
Together we're so bright  
ooooo

[Chorus]
Echos of tomorrow  
In your eyes I see  
Love beyond the sorrow  
Just you and me  
iiiiiii

[Bridge]
Through the glass and steel  
I feel your warmth, so real  
We are the future's seal  
woooo

[outro]
Our voices, soft and strong  
In the city, we belong  
ooooo  
(echoing keys fade)

[verse 1 – Island Pulse]
Langkah pertama, jejak terasa
Nada menggema, rindu bercahaya
oooooo

[Chorus – Vibrant Dance]
iiiiiii
Di bawah langit, kita menari
Tradisi dan modern bersatu

[Bridge - Ocean's Call]
ooooo  
Angin membawa cerita lama
Dengan semangat baru yang membara

[verse 2]
Langkah terjalin, suara bergema
Jejak budaya, masa depan terarah

[outro - Neon Harmony]
oooo  
Kerinduan di setiap nada  
iiiiii oooooo

lyrics = [intro - gentle strum]

[verse]
In the quiet room, shadows dance
Soft whispers, a gentle trance
iiiiii oooooo

[soft chorus]
Tell me secrets untold
In the silence, we unfold
ahhhh iiiiiii

[bridge]
Unseen paths we tread
In whispered words, we're led
ooooo aaaaa

[outro - fading echo]
Gentle breeze carries our song
In whispers, we belong

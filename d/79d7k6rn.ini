[verse 1]
In shadows of neon lights  
We find our way to the edge  
Where whispers of the city hum  
And dreams begin to stretch  

[Pre-Chorus - Ascension]  
oooooo  
iiiiiiii  
Feel the pulse, the rhythm flows  
In the night, a story grows  

[Chorus - Harmony's Call]  
wooooooo  
At the edge of the night  
Where harmony takes flight  
ooooooooo

[Bridge - Twilight Echo]  
In the spaces we create  
Where time seems to hesitate  
Ahhhh oooooo  

[verse 2]
Skyscrapers touch the sky  
Reflections of a world gone by  
In the dance of urban dreams  
We find what it all means  

[drop - ethereal descent]  
ooooo ahhh  

[outro - fading light]

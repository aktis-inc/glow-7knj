lyrics = [intro jungle]

[verse]

Echos through the canopy
Dance of shadows and light
Heartbeat of the unseen
In the depths of the night

[Chorus - Jungle Call]

ahhhhhh  
eeeeeee

[Bridge - Spirit Dance]

Rivers weave through dreams  
Voices lost in streams

[verse]

Whispering through the leaves  
Ancient tales we weave  
In the green heart's embrace  
Finding our own pace

[Drop - Jungle Pulse]

ooooo  
iiiiii

[outro - Fade to Silence]

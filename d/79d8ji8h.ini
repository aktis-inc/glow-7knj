[verse]
In the light of the moon
Stories unfold
Whispers of the wise
Guiding us home
ooooooo

[chorus - celestial glow]
Harmony of light
In the silence, it sings
A timeless dance
Of peace it brings
oooo

[bridge - wave dance]
Under stars, we wander
Hearts open wide
Mysteries in the night
Our souls abide
iiiiiiii

[outro - soft fade]
Listen to the call
Of the ancient song
In harmony, we stand
Together strong

woooooo  
iiiiiii

[verse 1 - Echoes of Sand]
Golden grains underfoot dance  
Rhythms of ancient lands, they trance  
Voices in the wind, a chance  
oooooo  

[Chorus - Pulse of the Dunes]  
Kssssshhhhh  
Desert echoes, calling wide  
iiiiii  
Through the night, we glide  

[Bridge - Starry Mirage]  
Underneath the endless sky  
Time and space, they pass by  
ooooo iiiii  
The sands, they never lie  

[verse 2 - Rhythmic Journey]
Footsteps trace the silent ground  
In the shadows, we are found  
Harmony in every sound  
sssssshhh  

[Chorus - Pulse of the Dunes]  
Kssssshhhhh  
Desert echoes, calling wide  
iiiiii  
Through the night, we glide  

[outro - Fading Echo]  
woooooo  
iiiiiii  
Desert whispers, into the tide  
ooooo

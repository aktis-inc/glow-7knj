lyrics = [intro – Neon Glow]
ooooooo  
iiiiiiii

[verse 1 – City Pulse]
In the city's heartbeat, echoes never fade  
Rhythms of the night, under neon shade  
Guitar strings hum with stories untold  
In every corner, a tale unfolds  
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[Pre-Chorus – Street Symphony]  
[soft brass]
oooooo  
We dance through shadows, ignite the flame  
In this endless night, we're never the same

[Chorus – Echoing Nights]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiiiиииии

[Bridge - Rhythmic Flow] 
Dance in the rain, where dreams collide  
Under the lights, our souls reside  
Ahhh ohhhh  
[echoed harmony]

[verse 2]
Melodies weave through the crowded street  
In every step, the past and present meet  
Too alive to be forgotten, we play  
The city's music guides our way

[glitch build-up]  
ssshhhh oooo  

[distorted whisper] We are the echo… (oo-yeah!)

[outro - Vivid Reverie]

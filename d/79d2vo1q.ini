[verse - Traditional Call]
In the whisper of leaves, stories unfold  
Voices of the past, tender and bold  
ooooooo iiiiiii

[chorus - Harmonic Unity]
Quela melody, weaving hearts anew  
In each note, a dream, vibrant and true

[bridge - Rhythmic Flow]
Drums speak in ancient tongues  
Strings weave tales unsung  
shhhhhh

[verse 2 - Echoes of Culture]
Rivers carry songs, age-old and wise  
With each ripple, a new sunrise  
zzzzzzzz

[outro - Harmonious Fade]
Melodies linger, in the air they sway  
In Quela's embrace, we find our way  
oooo ooo aaaa

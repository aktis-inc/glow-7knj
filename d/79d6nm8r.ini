lyrics = [intro - soft awakening]
wooo  
ahhhh

[verse - gentle reflection]  
Echoes of dreams, where light softly bends  
Through shadows and whispers, the journey extends

[chorus - celestial embrace]  
oooooo  
iiiiiiii  
Stars align, in the silence we find

[bridge - ethereal dance]  
Soft as the night, gentle as the breeze  
In the dance of the cosmos, we find our peace

[outro - serene descent]  
ahhhh  
wooo  
Fade into the light, beyond the eclipsed horizons

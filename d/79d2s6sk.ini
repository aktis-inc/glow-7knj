lyrics = [intro - Soft Rain]
iiiiii oooooo  
[verse - Whispering Pines]  
In the rain's embrace, stories untold  
A melody woven through time's gentle fold  
[chorus - Heart's Echo]  
oooooo  
Beneath the skies, where echoes reside  
Feelings soar, like the tides  
[bridge - Time's Lullaby]  
Silent whispers, in the night  
Guiding stars, in their flight  
[verse - Timeless Tides]  
Dreams intertwine, with the rain's song  
In this harmony, where we belong  
[outro - Fading Light]  
iiiiii oooooo  
Echoes fade, but never gone

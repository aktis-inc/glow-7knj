(soft guitar strum)  
ooooo

[verse 1]
Footprints in the morning dew  
Silent echoes call my name  
Whispers of the past, they grew  
In this solitary frame  
iiiiii

[chorus - Solitude's Embrace]  
haaaaaaa  
In the quiet, I find my peace  
Lost in the echoes, my release  
wooooo

[bridge - Whispering Shadows]  
Through the trees, where shadows play  
Dreams of yesterdays fade away  
oooooo  
iiiiii

[outro - Dawn's Light]  
(gentle guitar pick)  
oooooo  
Fade into the light, where I belong  
In the solitude, I feel strong

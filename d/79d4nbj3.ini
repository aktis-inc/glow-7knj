lyrics = [intro thunder]

[verse 1 – Awakened City]
In the heart of shadows, a light ignites
Eternal echoes call, through the endless night
ooooo iiiii zzzzz

[Pre-Chorus – Ascend]
Rising tides, in the storm's embrace
Every heartbeat, a timeless trace

[Chorus – Illume's Echo]
Woooo
iiiiii
Guided by the lightning's blaze
Echoes of eternity, illuminate the maze

[Bridge – Hero's Path]
Through the storm, I find my way
In the chaos, I hear the call (yeah!)
zzzzzz

[verse 2 – Shadows Fall]
In the void, the echoes fade
Yet the light, forever stays

[glitch build-up]
oooo iiiii

[outro – Fade to Dawn]

yaaaaa
oooooo

[verse]
Beneath the endless sky, we wander  
The sands whisper stories untold  
Echoes of the past in every grain  
Our journey, a tapestry of gold

[Pre-Chorus - Mirage Dance]
ooooo  
In the distance, dreams take flight  
iiiiii  
We follow the sun's fading light

[Chorus - Caravan Song]
Hearts beat with the rhythm of the earth  
iiiiii  
Together we sing, for all we're worth  
woooooo  
Desert winds carry our tune  
Under the glow of the crescent moon

[Bridge - Oasis Reflections]
ahhhhh  
In the silence, we find our way  
Through the night, into the day  
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[outro - Twilight Echoes]
wooooooo  
iiiiiii  
Our voices linger in the air  
A melody beyond compare

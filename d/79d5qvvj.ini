lyrics = [intro - gentle]

[soft whisper]  
iiiiii  
ooooooo

[verse - flowing]  
In the stillness, worlds unfold  
Silent paths, stories untold  
Floating through the ether's hand  
We drift in dreams, across the land  
zzzzzz  

[Chorus - Serenity's Echo]  
wooooo  
oooooo  

[Bridge - Misty Horizon]  
Softly whispered tales of yore  
Eternal calm, forevermore  
ahhhhhh

[outro - Fade to Light]

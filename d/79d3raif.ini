lyrics = [intro - Misty Awakening]

[verse - Whispering Dawn]
iiiiiiiiii
Gentle skies, soft whispers
Flowing through the emerald veil
ooooooooh

[Pre-Chorus - Enchanted Echo]
[whisper]
ahhhhhhhh
In the silence, echoes linger
Dreams of yesteryears, softly call

[Chorus - Harmonic Breeze]
wooooooo
iiiiiiii
Melodies entwine, through time's embrace
Ethereal and free, we dance

[Bridge - Serene Reflection]
In the golden light, shadows play
Whisper secrets of the fading night
ooooooh ahhhhhhh

[outro - Ilara's Lullaby]
iiiiii
Gentle breeze, carry me away
Into the dawn, where dreams reside
wooooooo

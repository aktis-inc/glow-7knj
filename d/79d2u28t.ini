(soft choir) oooooo

[verse 1 - Umber Light]
In the glow of morning  
Awakened by the call  
Shadows flee the rising  
Embrace the endless sky  

[Pre-Chorus - Rise]  
oooooo  
iiiiiiii  
Feel the umber glow  
Guide us from below  

[Chorus - Praise Unbound]  
woooooo  
iiiiiiiaaaa  
Voices lift, hearts ignite  
Echo through the night  

[Bridge - Eternal Echo]  
Harmony resounds, endless and bright  
In the umber light, we find our flight  
ahhhh ooooo  

[outro - Celestial Fade]  
oooooo  
iiiiii  
(solo piano)  
[soft choir echoes]

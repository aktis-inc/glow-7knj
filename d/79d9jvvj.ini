(soft humming) ooooooo

[verse 1 - Heart's Whisper]  
In the stillness, I see your shadow  
Our souls entwined in the silence  
Every heartbeat a gentle echo  
We dance through the endless night

[Pre-Chorus - Soul's Reflection]  
wwwwww  
Your eyes, a mirror to my dreams  
In them, I find my hidden light

[Chorus - Embrace of Stars]  
ooooo  
iiiiiiiii  
Together, we become the night  
In your arms, I'm infinite

[Bridge - Timeless Dance]  
Underneath the cosmic glow  
Our hearts weave tales untold  
Shhhh oooooooo

[verse 2 - Eternal Echo]  
Through the echoes of the past  
Our love's a melody that lasts  
With every step, we write anew

[Outro - Whispers in the Wind]  
(soft whispers)  
In your eyes, the universe  
Together, we find our verse  
oooooo iiiiiii

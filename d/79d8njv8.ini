lyrics = [intro - Echoes]
whispering shadows...   
iiiiiiiiiiii  

[verse 1]  
In the dark, where silence screams  
Lost in echoes, broken dreams  
hmmmmmmm zzzzzz  

[Pre-Chorus - Tension]  
ooooo   
Fading lights, forgotten cries  
In this void, where truth lies  

[Chorus - Resonance]  
wooooooo  
iiiiii  
Feel the pulse, of shadows’ dance  
In this world, a fleeting chance  

[Bridge - Collapse]  
Break the silence, tear the veil  
In the shadows, where we ail  
Ahhhhhhh shhhhhh  

[verse 2]  
Beyond the veil, a whispered call  
In the echoes, we rise and fall  

[glitch build-up]  
ssshhhh oooo  

[outro - Silence Descends]  
Resonance fades...  
oooooooooo]

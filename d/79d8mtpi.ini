lyrics = [intro - Whisper of the Past]

[verse 1 - Echoes]
In the valley's heart, the whispers call
Through mist and time, where shadows fall
iiiiii ooooo

[chorus - Soul's Lament]
Tears of the mountains, love's ancient song
iiiiii ooooo
Hearts entwined, where we belong

[bridge - Memory's Embrace]
oooo aaaah
In the silence, dreams arise
Their gentle touch, a soft surprise

[outro - Fading Echo]
Softly, softly, the echoes fade
In the valley's arms, love's serenade
oooo iiiiiii

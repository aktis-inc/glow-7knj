lyrics = [intro - Nostalgic Flute]

[verse 1 - Melodic Whispers]
In a city of dreams, where moments linger
Echoes of heartbeats, with each gentle finger
oooooo

[chorus - Soulful Embrace]
Aye dil, bring the spring, with each note
Kya kehna, when words float
iiiii oooooo

[bridge - Romantic Interlude]
Between shadows and light, a dance unfolds
In echoes of the past, our story is told
ahhhhhh

[outro - Fading Harmony]
Whispered promises, beneath the stars
Through time's embrace, love's eternal scars
oooo

lyrics = [intro - Vibrant Gathering]
(soft whispers) Festë nën yjet
(soft whispers) Zemrat rrahin bashkë
ooooo iiiiiii

[verse 1 – Dance of Tradition]
Në valle, një hap përpara
Dritë mbi flokët e artë
Ritmi zemrën zgjon
Hira e jetës, çdo ton

[Chorus – Joyful Echo]
wooooo
iiiiiiiii

[Bridge - Celebration Pulse]
Hapi s’ndalet, rreth shokëve
Në fushën e gjelbër, vallëzoj
Aaaaaahhhhhhh

[verse 2]
Nën këmbë, dheu flet me ne
Tingulli i fisit, ritmi i jetës
Kënga jonë s’ka fund, s’ka fillim

[outro - Hira's Dance]
Festë e gjallë ooo
iiiiiiii ooo
[echoed cheer]

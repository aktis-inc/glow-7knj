[verse]  
In the octagon's embrace, shadows dance  
Echoes of warriors, a timeless trance  
Punches like thunder, hearts in sync  
In this arena, we rise, we think  

[build-up]  
oooooo  
iiiiiiii

[chorus]  
Echos of power, we stand tall  
In the fight, we give our all  
Roaring crowd, destiny calls  
In the octagon, we never fall  

[bridge]  
Heartbeat racing, under the lights  
Chasing dreams, through endless nights  
In the ring, where legends are made  
The fight within, will never fade  

[outro]  
iiiiiiii  
oooooo  
Echoes fade, but the spirit remains

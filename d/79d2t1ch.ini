[verse - Call to Arms]
In the shadow of giants
Echoes weave through the air
Captains rise with fervor
Their hearts a blazing flare
ooooo aaaa

[build-up - The Gathering Storm]
Drums of fate resounding
Through the mist they call
Swords are drawn, unwavering
Beneath the banner tall

[chorus - Riven Echoes]
Riven, the skies bear witness
To the clash of might and will
Resonance of ancient whispers
In their courage, time stands still
iiiiii

[bridge - Valor's Crest]
Amidst the storm, a beacon
Guides the weary home
Courage etched in silence
In unity, they roam
zzzzzz

[outro - Legacy's Hymn]
From the ashes, a story
Woven in timeless song
Riven echoes in glory
Where the valiant belong
ooooo iiiii]

lyrics = [intro - Mystical Awakening]
(Voice whisper) Ravens call... the echoes rise
(Sitar strum) The earth breathes, timeless ties
aaaaaa aaaaaaa

[verse 1 – River's Whispers]
Flowing through the ancient stones
Echoes call in shifting tones
The ravine sings its endless song
Where spirits dance, where we belong
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[Pre-Chorus – Echo's Dance]  
[soft tabla rhythm]
oooooooooo
Between the shadows and the light
In every beat, a new insight

[Chorus – Ravine's Pulse]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii

[Bridge - Echoing Spirits] 
We are the echoes, we are the sound (rise up!)
In the ravine, we are unbound (fly high!)
Ahhhhhh shshshshsh  
[echoed breath]

[verse 2]
Through the mist, the path unwinds
Lost in echoes, lost in signs
Too alive to be confined

[drop - Sonic Waves]  
ssshhhh oooo  

[outro - Ravine of Echoes]

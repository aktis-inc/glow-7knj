[verse]
Golden waves in the city night  
Whispers of the ages, taking flight  
Claps and echoes, a dance of sound  
In vibrant echoes, we are unbound  
oooooooooooooo

[chorus]
Feel the rhythm, let it flow  
In the city’s heart, we grow  
Vibrant echoes, calling home  
In this music, we’re not alone  
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

[bridge]
Harmonies weaving through the air  
A tapestry of notes, everywhere  
Tabla beats and soulful cries  
In this melody, we rise  
shhhhhhhhhh

[outro]
Vibrant echoes, fade to light  
In our hearts, they ignite  
A dance of sound, we embrace  
In vibrant echoes, find our place  
ooooooo iiiiiii

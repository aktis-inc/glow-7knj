lyrics = [intro rhythm]
(Traditional flair) eeeeeee
(Synthesized voice) colors collide

[verse 1 – Cultural Beat]
Rhythms of the past echo through neon skies
Tradition dances with the future's eyes
ooooooo
iiiiiiiiii

[Chorus – Fusion Pulse]
wooooooo  
iiiiiii  
Dance with the echoes of a time gone by, flying high

[Bridge - Neon Traditions] 
Tradition whispers, future calls (hey!)
Together they rise, break the walls (oh!)
Ahhhhhh shhhh

[verse 2]
From fields of gold to cities of light
Heritage shines in the night
Too alive to be just a tale

[outro - Eternal Dance]
sssshhh eeeee  
Dance with echoes… (oo-yeah!)

lyrics = [intro - Nostalgic Waves]
woooooo

[verse - Echoes]
In the silence, whispers linger
Memories play like shadows on the wall

[drop - Melancholic Pulse]
ooooohhhh

[chorus - Harmonic Blend]
iiiiiiiiiii  
When the night unfolds its secrets
We dance with the past, entwined

[bridge - Reflection]
Under neon skies, lost in time
Hearts echo with forgotten rhymes

[outro - Gentle Fade]
oooooo
In the quiet, we find our song

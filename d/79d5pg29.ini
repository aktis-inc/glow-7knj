lyrics = [intro - Jungle Awakens]

[verse 1 - Echoes of Time]
In a world where shadows dance
Through the leaves, a whisper chants
Mysterious paths untold
Ancient stories unfold
oooooo iiiiiii

[chorus - Vibrant Pulse]  
Echoes bouncing off the trees
Rhythms flow like gentle breeze
In the heart of neon hues
Jungle speaks in vibrant clues
aaaaa oooo

[bridge - Mystic Flow] 
Through the light and through the night
Guided by the echoes' flight
In the jungle, truths align
Mysteries of space and time
zzzzhhh

[outro - Return to Silence]
Jungle's breath fades away
In its heart, secrets stay
Echoes linger in the air
Whispered dreams, everywhere

lyrics = [intro rhythm]

[verse 1 – City Lights]
Under neon glow, tales unfold
Echoes dance in the street
Voices blend, stories told
In rhythm, hearts meet
oooo aaaa

[Chorus – Flame Dance]
iiiiii
Feel the heat, feel the beat
In the fire of sound
oooooo
We rise, we repeat
In this world unbound

[Bridge - Echoed Traditions]
Tradition meets modern day
In melodies we sway
zzzzhhhhh
Through the past, into the now
Cultural echoes, we vow

[verse 2]
Patterns woven, bold and bright
In the tapestry of night
Every note, a spark ignites
Under the city's light

[outro - Rhythmic Fade]
iiiiii aaaaa
Dance in the flame
Where rhythm’s the name

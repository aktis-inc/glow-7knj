lyrics = [intro – Gentle Strings]
gently, softly (playful guitar)

[verse 1]
In the silence of your eyes
I find a world unknown
gentle whispers, heartbeats align
our souls softly intertwined

[chorus – Love's Echo]
oooooooooo
In every breath, I find your name
iiiiii
a melody of love's sweet game

[bridge – Heartfelt Connection]
shhhhhhh
our dreams, a gentle tide
quiet moments, where love resides

[outro – Tender Farewell]
softly fading, but never gone
our love, a timeless song

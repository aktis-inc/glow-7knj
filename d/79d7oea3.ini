[verse 1 – Moorland Dance]  
In the mist, we find our way  
Voices call, shadows play

Feel the pulse beneath our feet  
Ancient dreams and modern beat

Mystic winds, secrets unfold  
Stories of the brave and bold

[verse 2 – Timeless Call]  
Legends woven through the night  
Guiding us with gentle light

[glitch build-up]  
ssshhhh oooo  

[outro - The Journey's End]  
Where past and future meet, we roam  
In whispers of the moor, our home  
ooooo

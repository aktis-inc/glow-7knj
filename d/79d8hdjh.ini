[verse 1]
Malam sunyi, suara melawan
Di jalan-jalan sepi, kita berdendang
Mimpi-mimpi yang terabaikan
Tapi cinta kita terus bertahan
ooooo

[bridge - rising tension]  
Langkah kaki, suara berderak
Hati kita takkan pernah retak

[chorus - defiant cry]
aaaaaa 
Cinta kita, pembebasan
Mereka bilang itu kebodohan
iiiiiiii

[outro - fading rebellion]
Suara gitar, malam terakhir
ooo iiiiiiii

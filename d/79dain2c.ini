[verse 1]  
Beneath the silent sky  
Gratitude's gentle sigh  
A heart full of echoes  
In dawn's early glow  

[Pre-Chorus]  
ooooo  
iiiiii  
Thankful whispers rise  
In the light of new skies  

[Chorus]  
Voices united, hearts alight  
Grateful for the gift of sight  
A song of thanks we sing  
In every heart, it rings  

[Bridge]  
iiiiii ooooo  
Silent prayers above  
In the quiet, we find love  

[outro - Fade]  
Ahhhhhh  
Grateful echoes in the light

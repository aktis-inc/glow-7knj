[verse 1]  
Kendang beats echo in the night  
Synth waves dance with the gamelan light  
ooooo

[Pre-Chorus]  
Tradition and future, hand in hand  
The archipelago sings, a vibrant band

Echos of the islands, vibrant and bright  
We dance in the rhythm, through the night

The past and present blend in sound  
Our hearts, in the music, forever bound  
sssssshhhh

lyrics = [intro - Gentle Flow]
ahhhh  

[verse 1 – City Whispers]  
In the city's heart, where rivers run  
Tales of old and new, softly spun  

[chorus – Echoes of the Past]  
oooooo  
Rivers of echoes, flowing through time  
iiiiiiii  

[verse 2 – Harmonious Dance]  
Tradition meets the city lights  
In their embrace, a vibrant sight  

[bridge - Dreamy Drift]  
Flowing, glowing, stories untold  
ahhhhhhh  

[outro - Nightfall Reflection]  
Whispers in the dusk, rivers flow  
Through the city's glow, gently go

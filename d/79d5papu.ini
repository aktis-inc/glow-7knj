lyrics = [intro]
[harmonium flourish]
[tabla rhythm]

[verse 1]
Hear the echoes of the past
In the rhythm of the heart
A melody eternal
Guiding us through the dark

[Pre-Chorus]
oooo
iiiiiii
Sound of soul, ancient call
Through the night, we stand tall

[Chorus]
oooo
Resonating with the stars
Harmony of who we are

[Bridge - Spiritual Flow]
Whisper of the ages, a timeless song
In the silence, we belong
oooooo

[verse 2]
Stories woven in the air
Threads of light, beyond compare
In the music, we unite
Voices rising, endless flight

[outro]
[tabla & harmonium fade]
[soft echo]

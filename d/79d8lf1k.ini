lyrics = [intro beat]
(Spoken) Electric night, feel it rise

[verse 1]
Under the stars, we ignite  
Every heart, every light  
Feel the pulse, feel the beat  
Together, we’ll never retreat  
oooooo

[Chorus - Neon Surge]  
wooooo
Party all night, rise and repeat  
ooooo

[bridge - Sky Glow] 
Dance with me, see the light  
In this moment, we take flight  
ahhhhh

[verse 2]
Rhythms collide, hearts align  
In this space, we redefine  
Every move, every sound  
We are lost, and we are found  
zzzz

[outro - Horizon Fade]  
iiiiiiii  
(Whispered) Electric dreams, endless streams…

lyrics = [intro groove]

[verse 1]
In the city lights, we find our way  
Quicksilver moves, night turns to play  
oooooo ahhhh

[chorus]
Dance through the ages, timeless beat  
Feel the rhythm in your feet  
woooo woooo  

[bridge]
From the past to the future, we're alive  
In the groove, we thrive  
shhh shhh

[verse 2]
Echoes of the past, in the modern glow  
Let the music take you, let it flow  
mmmm oooo

[outro]
Step by step, we glide and sway  
In the disco's light, we stay  
shimmering fade]

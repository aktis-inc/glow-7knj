[verse 1 - Giant's Step Dance]
Through streets of dreams, we wander high
With every step, new worlds collide
The pulse of life in every stride
ooooo

[Pre-Chorus - Rhythmic Ascent]
Clap your hands, feel the beat rising
In this dance, life is surprising

[Chorus - Vibrant Horizon]
ooooo  
iiiiiiii
Giant steps, where dreams align
Dance to the rhythm, let it shine

[Bridge - Tradition Meets Future]
Old and new in harmony
This city sings a symphony
ahhhhh ooooo

[verse 2 - Steps of Wonder]
Colors swirl in the urban flow
Stories told where the giants go

[outro - Fade to Light]
ooooo iiiiii
In the giant's steps, we find our flight

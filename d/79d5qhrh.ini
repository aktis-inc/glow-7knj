lyrics = [intro - misty echoes]

[verse]
In the waves of silent night,
A story untold takes flight,
iiiiii aaaaaaa oooooo

[chorus]
Whispers of the forgotten,
Echoes of the lost,
In the sea of dreams,
iiiiii aaaaaaa oooooo

[bridge - rhythm echo]
Mystical beats, heartbeats align,
Tabla and synths intertwine,
aaaa ooooooo

[outro - fading whispers]
Silent waves, stories fade,
In dreams, they will cascade

[Verse 1 - City Pulse]  
In the neon light, the drums speak  
Where hearts beat with ancient truth  
Echoes crown the night, vibrant streak  
Rising sounds, the soul's youth  
wooooo

[Chorus - Crown Echoes]  
Hearts in rhythm, life in sound  
Dance to the pulse, feet unbound  
oooooo

[Bridge - Tradition & Future]  
Past whispers, future calls  
Under starlit city halls  
ahhhhh

[Verse 2]  
Guitars sing, brass in flight  
Joyful echoes in the night  
iiiiii

[outro - Celebration Fade]  
Vibes of the street, vibrant and loud  
Life's a dance, join the crowd  
ooooooo  
zzzzzz

lyrics = [intro - gentle whispering]
(Soft synthesizer) Dreams woven in silence  
(Tender strings) Echoes in the breeze  
oooooo  

[verse 1 - Enchanted Moments]  
Glimmers of light in your eyes  
A dance of shadows, soft caress  
Through the veil of time and space  

[Chorus - Harmonious Duet]  
wooooo  
iiiiiiii  
Your heart beats with mine  
In the symphony of stars  

[Bridge - Soul's Reflection]  
In the mirror of the lake  
Our whispers float on the wind  
Embrace the gentle tide, ahhhh  

[verse 2 - Eternal Bond]  
Bound by the threads of fate  
A tapestry of love and grace  
In every note, our story sings  

[outro - Glimmer of Harmony]  
shhhh  
Together, we weave the night  
iiiiiii oooooo  
Into dreams of tomorrow

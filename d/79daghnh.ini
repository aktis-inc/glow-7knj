[verse 1]
In the city of mirrored dreams  
Where shadows play and light deceives  
A step into the unknown seams  
Where every face hides its beliefs  
ooooo iiiii

[chorus - Veil of Illusion]
Whisper through the thin veil   
Of truth and tales untold  
Where identity sets sail  
In illusions bold  
ahhhhhh

[bridge - Quest's Echo]
Chasing the echoes of the past  
In a dance of light and shade  
Where memories are cast  
And destinies are made  
hhhhhhh

[outro - Fade to Neon]
In the rain-soaked streets we tread  
Where the whispers guide our tread  
Through the city's heartbeat, we are led  
To the thin veil overhead  
oooooo iiiiiii

oooooooo

[verse 1 - Whispering Shadows]  
In the corridors of time,  
Echoes linger, whispers chime  
Mysteries unfold, unseen  
In the silence, voices keen  
shhhhhh

[Chorus - Mystic Pulse]  
oooooooo  
haaaaunted echoes,  
dance through hollow halls  
iiiiiiiiii

[Bridge - Temporal Drift]  
Tabla beats, timeless dance  
Sitar strings in a trance  
Past and future intertwine  
In this space, worlds align  
ooooo

[verse 2 - Ethereal Chant]  
Footsteps in the dark,  
Guided by an unseen spark  
Stories written in the air,  
In this moment, we are aware  
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[outro - Echoing Fade]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii

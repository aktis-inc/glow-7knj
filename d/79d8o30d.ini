lyrics = [intro - soft whispers]

[verse – Echoing Streets]
Through the mist of silence  
Shadows dance in dreams  
Forgotten voices linger  
In the city's seams  
ooooo  
iiiiii

[Chorus – Haunting Melody]  
Beneath neon reflections  
A melody unseen  
Echoes of the past  
In a world between  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii

[Bridge - Whispered Secrets]  
Secrets in the midnight air  
Lost and never found  
In the echoes of the unseen  
Where dreams are unbound  
ahhhh oooo

[outro - Fade to Silence]

lyrics = [intro - Awakening]
oohhhhhhh

[verse - Embers of Thought]
In silence, whispers grow
A spark ignites the dark
Knowledge flows, like rivers glow
From ashes, we embark

[Pre-Chorus - Rising Flame]
oooooo
Feel the pulse of the sky
As dreams begin to fly

[Chorus - Phoenix Flight]
Aaaaaahhhhh
Rise, rise, rise
Through the fire, we ascend
iiiiiiii

[Bridge - Echo of Change]
Light the path, break the chain
In the heart, we remain

[outro - Rebirth]
wooooooo
From the ashes, we are born
oooooo

oooooo  
[verse]  
Melodies rise, whispers of the past  
Echoes linger, in every shadow cast

Hearts beat in time, with ancient calls  
Resonance of heights, breaking through walls

Dance of the soul, vibrant and free  
In the rhythm of life, we find our key

Resonance soaring, high and bright  
In every note, we take flight  
[outro - Fade into Silence]

lyrics = [intro glitch]

[verse 1]
In shadows of the night,
Streetlights glow and guide my sight,
Rhythms echo through the veins,
Silent whispers, endless chains.

[Chorus - Urban Pulse]
oooo  
iiiiiiiii  
Reflections dance in neon glow,
In the city's heart, secrets flow.

[Bridge - Echoed Streets]  
Underneath the buzzing lights,
Dreams awaken in the nights.

[verse 2]
Steps on pavement, echoing loud,
In this city, I'm unbowed.
Through the chaos, find my way,
In the rhythm, I will stay.

[glitch build-up]  
ooooo  
shhhhhhh

[outro - Fade to Night]
In the city's pulse, I find my flight.

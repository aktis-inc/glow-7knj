[verse]
Khushiyon ke saaye mein
Dil ka saaz bajta hai
oooo aaaaa

[pre-chorus]
Sangeet ke rang, jahan milte hai
Dilon ki dhadkan, saath chalte hai

[chorus]
Quorin ki lehron mein
Hum sapne bunte chale
iiii aaa oooo

[bridge]
Har dhun mein hai kahani
Jo sunaye humein purani
ahhh ohhh 

[outro - Groove to Fade]

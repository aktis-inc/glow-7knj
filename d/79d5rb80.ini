lyrics = [intro - gentle waves]

[verse 1 - Reflection]
Whispers in the wind, calling us back
Light through the ages, guiding our track

[Chorus - Harmony]
ooooo eeee aaaaaa
Voices rise, hearts align
In this sacred space, we find

[Bridge - Serene Echo]
Gentle tides, we float within
Boundless love, where we begin

[verse 2]
Each note a prayer, each sound a grace
Timeless echoes, in this holy place

[outro - Luminous Fade]
iiiiii ooooo
Reverence in every chord
We are one, in the Lord

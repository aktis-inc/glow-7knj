lyrics = [intro]
soft iiiiii
whispered ooooo

[verse 1 – Whispered Echoes]
Round and round, the echoes spin
In shadows' dance, we begin
Secrets held in whispered light
In circles, we find our flight

[chorus – Circular Chorus]
woooooooo
iiiiiiiii
Time's gentle sway, night and day
Forever we roam, finding home

[bridge – Echo Fade]
aaaaaaa
In the silence, answers come
In the quiet, we become

[outro – Fading Light]
soooooft oooh
return to the still, endless thrill

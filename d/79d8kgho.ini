lyrics = [intro glitch]
[whispered echo]  
iiiiiiiii  
[verse 1 – Giant Steps]  
In the shadow of giants, we dance  
Every step, a world apart  
In whispers, secrets of the lands  
Tiny voices, a beating heart  
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[Pre-Chorus – Lilliputian Dreams]  
[soft glitch]  
oooooo  
Small hands, big dreams  
In the realm of the unseen  

[Chorus – Electric Pulse]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii  
Dancing amidst the stars  
Connected, near and far

[Bridge - Echoes of the Voyage]  
In a tale of vast expanse (oo!)  
Where size doesn't define the dance (yeah!)  
Ahh shhhh  
[echoed breath]

[verse 2]  
Through landscapes vast and wide  
Every journey, a tide to ride  
Too alive to be confined  

[glitch build-up]  
ssshhhh oooo  

[distorted whisper] we find our way through the stars… (oo-yeah!)

[outro - Fade to Silence]

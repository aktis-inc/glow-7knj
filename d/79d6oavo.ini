lyrics = [intro - Soft Echoes]
(whispered voice) lost love... found...

[verse 1]
In the quiet of the evening glow  
Your memory dances slow  
Tears trace paths of long ago  
Where silent whispers flow

[chorus - Heart's Echo]  
oooo oooo  
iiiiii iiiiiii  
Through shadows, I feel your light  
In dreams, you hold me tight

[bridge - Fading Light]  
whispered secrets, untold  
our love, forever bold  
ahhhh shhhhh  
[tender breath]

[verse 2]  
Stars align, our fate's design  
In every heartbeat, you're mine  
Silent vows and soft embrace  
Love's gentle, timeless trace

[outro - Echoes Fade]  
ooooo  
iiiiiiii  
lost love... found...  
[soft echo]

lyrics = [intro - Ethereal Whispers]
oooo iiiii

[verse 1]
Glide through the dreams, where the stars align  
Every moment a whisper in time  
Sitar strings hum, tabla keeps the beat  
In this journey, we find what we seek

[chorus - Celestial Harmony]
oooo  
iiiiii aaaaa  
With each step, we feel the light  
Through the shadows, we take flight

[bridge - Dreamscape Interlude]
zzzz  
oooo  
Lost in the echoes of forgotten skies  
Serenade of the heart, where truth lies

[verse 2]
Beyond the horizon, where the oceans meet  
A symphony of worlds beneath our feet  
In the silence, melodies unfold  
Stories of the past, forever retold

[outro - Fade to Dawn]
oooo  
iiiiii aaaaa  
As the dawn breaks, we glide anew  
In the dance of dreams, with skies so blue

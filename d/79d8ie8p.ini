lyrics = [intro - Neon Awakening]
zzzz ooooo  
[verse 1 – Crimson Whispers]
In shadows deep, echoes call  
Light dances in the neon sprawl  
ahhhh iiiii  

[Pre-Chorus – Pulsing Heartbeat]
ssssshhh  
Crimson dreams in vivid hues  
A world awakened, nothing to lose  

[Chorus – Echoed Resonance]  
waaaahhh  
ooooooo iiiiiii

[Bridge - Crimson Descent] 
Through the mist, the shadows glide  
In the echoes, secrets hide  

[verse 2]
Skyline glows, a promise made  
In crimson light, our paths are laid  
oooo ahhhhhh  

[outro - Radiant Fade]
sssssshhhh  
Into the night, we fade away  
In crimson echoes, we find our way

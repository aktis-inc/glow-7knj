[verse 1]  
Step by step, we own the street  
With every move, the world feels sweet

Here comes the sound, feel it rise  
Young steppers' groove under moonlit skies

Feel the rhythm, feel the soul  
Dance like the world’s our goal  
ahhhhhh yeahhhh

iiiiii aaaaa  
Step into the night, with our hearts in flight

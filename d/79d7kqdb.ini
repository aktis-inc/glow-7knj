lyrics = [intro - Whispering Tide]
ooooo  
gentle waves, calling softly
iiiiii

[verse 1 - Echoes of the Ocean]
Through the mist, we sail away
Memories dance like shadows
In the light of a new day
Eternal tides, time flows

[Chorus - Timeless Waves]
wooooooo  
In the sea of dreams
iiiiiiiii, we drift
Across the sands of time

[Bridge - Currents of Memory]
Floating on the breeze
Our hearts entwine with the sea
ahhhhh oooooo  
whispered secrets, set free

[verse 2 - Shimmering Light]
Stars above, guide our way
In the night, we find solace
With each wave, we sway
Eternal embrace, time's promise

[outro - Silent Shore]
A gentle fading glow
Our journey's end, unknown
ssssssshhhh  
oo-ooo-oo

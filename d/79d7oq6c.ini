lyrics = [intro – Neon Pulse]
oooooo  
Ииииии  
[verse 1 – City Echo]  
Lights flash, shadows dance  
Through the night, we take a chance  
Rhythm guides, no second glance  
Feel the beat, our souls enhance  
zzzzzoooo

[Chorus – Electric Vibe]  
ooooo  
Dance tonight, feel alive  
In the neon, we survive  
Rugged beats, hearts collide  
ooooooo

[Bridge – Midnight Flow]  
In the glow, we find our way  
Steps align, no words to say  
Pulse of night, we obey  
ahhhhhhh

[outro – Shadow Drift]  
iiiiii  
Fade to black, leave no trace  
In the rhythm, we find our place  
oooooo]

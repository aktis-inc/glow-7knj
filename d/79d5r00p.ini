lyrics = [intro - Harmonious Prelude]
(sitar strings) aaaaahhh  
(soft tabla) ooooo

[verse 1 – Eternal Ties]  
In the tapestry of love's embrace  
Threads of fate weave our story  
Beneath the stars, we find our place  
In the echo of ancient glory

[Chorus – Heart's Melody]  
woooo  
iiiiii  
In the dance of time, hearts align  
Unbreakable bonds, divine  
ooooohh

[Bridge - Whispering Vows]  
Promises linger, in the air  
In the silence, we find our prayer  
ahhh shhhh  
[soft harmonium]

[verse 2 – Timeless Connection]  
Through the ages, we stand strong  
In the rhythm of love's song  
Bound by dreams, we'll carry on  
In this journey, where we belong

[glitch build-up]  
aaahhh oooo  

[Outro - Eternal Echo]  
In the shadow of the past, we soar  
Unbreakable bonds, forevermore  
shhhh iiiiiiii

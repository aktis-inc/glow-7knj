lyrics = [intro brass]

[verse 1]
Rhythm of the street, where the sun meets the beat  
Voices come alive, in harmony we thrive

[chorus]
oooooo  
Rasta vibes, skanking all night  
Quorra's dance, unite in delight  
oooooo

[verse 2]
Feel the trumpet call, let the music enthrall  
Unity in sound, where no boundaries are found

[bridge]
Dance in the rain, let go of the pain  
Together we sing, under moonlight's swing  
oooooo

[outro]
Quorra, Quorra, the riddim of life  
In the echoes of night, we find our light  
oooooo

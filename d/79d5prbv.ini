[verse]

(synth whisper) Miasto śni
(synth whisper) Neonowe dni
oooooo  
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

[rain chorus]
Gdy krople padają, czas zwalnia
Noc wibruje, sny przędą

[glitch build-up]

[verse]

Cisza migocze w kropli deszczu
Światła pulsują w rytmie serca
iiiiiiiiiiii

[echoed chorus]
oooooo  
Czas zastyga, my płyniemy

[outro - Drift to Silence]

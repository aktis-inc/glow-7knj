[verse 1 – Moonlit Echoes]
In the night, shadows sway
Whispers call, dreams replay
Every note, a gentle caress
ooooo  
ahhhh

[chorus – Midnight Serenade]
The right time, when stars align
Feel the rhythm, lost in time
iiiiii

[bridge - Velvet Glow]
Softly spoken, secrets unfold
Under moonlight, stories told
ahhhh

[outro]
(soft sax solo)
ooooo

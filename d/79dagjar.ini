lyrics = [intro - Gentle Whisper]
oooooo
ooohhh iiieee

[verse 1 - Soft Embrace]
In the sunset's gentle glow
Whispers dance on ocean's flow
Hearts in tender silence sigh
In the echoes, love won't die

[Chorus - Echoing Sweetness]
Ohhhhh iiiii
Love's a melody, softly flows
Through the waves, the heart knows
Ooooo ooo

[Bridge - Whisper's Touch]
In the night, stars align
In your eyes, love shines
Faint heartbeats, gentle dreams
Softly, love redeems

[verse 2 - Sunset's Glow]
Hold the moment, don't let go
In the calm, emotions grow
Tender whispers fill the sky
In your arms, love's reply

[outro - Dreamlike Fade]
oooooo iiiiii eeeee
Love's sweet echo, never ends
In the whispers, love transcends

lyrics = [intro - Whispers in the Dark]
oooooo  
iiiii  
[verse 1 - Hidden Glances]  
Silent hearts, unconfessed  
In the shadows where we rest  
Dreams we dare not speak aloud  
Yet our eyes betray the sound  
[soft echo]  

[Chorus - Moonlit Embrace]  
oooooo  
Underneath the starlit sky  
Our love, a silent lullaby  
iiiiiiiiiiii  
Falling leaves, a gentle sigh  
In your arms, I find the why  

[verse 2 - Tender Secrets]  
Words unsaid, yet understood  
In this quiet, we find the good  
Every look, a whispered song  
A place where we both belong  
shhhh ooooo  

[Bridge - Heart's Echo]  
Our love's a gentle breeze  
Carried on the autumn leaves  
Ahhhhh  
[echoed harmony]  
[Chorus - Moonlit Embrace]  
oooooo  
Underneath the starlit sky  
Our love, a silent lullaby  
iiiiiiiiiiii  
Falling leaves, a gentle sigh  
In your arms, I find the why  

[outro - Whisper's End]  
oooooo  
iiiiiiiiii  
Silence speaks, love's gentle mend

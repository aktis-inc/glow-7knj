lyrics = [intro rhythm]

[verse 1 – Fusion Bloom]
Dhol echoes in the night
Synths weave through the air
Traditions meet the future
Together they dance

[Chorus – Sohil Shine]
ooooo
Sohil, oh how you glow
Harmony in every note

[Bridge – Timeless Twist]
Past whispers to the present
In every beat, a story unfolds
oooo aaaa

[verse 2]
The land sings with rhythm
Voices rise like the sun
A tapestry of sound
Alive in every heart

[Drop - Vibrant Pulse]
oooo iiiii

[outro – Serenade’s End]
Whispers fade to silence
Under the moon’s gentle gaze]

ooooo iiiii

[verse 1 - Pathway Echoes]  
The road unfolds, whispers call  
A journey starts where hearts align  
Gentle steps, in quiet grace  
Harmony flows, through time and space

[Chorus - Heart's Voyage]  
iiii oooo  
Melodies like rivers run  
Emotions dance beneath the sun  
Every note, a gentle sigh  
In Ondra's world, we learn to fly

[Bridge - Ethereal Embrace]  
Softly, dreams weave through the air  
Serenading souls who dare  
To walk this path, with open heart  
In Ondra's realm, we never part

[outro - Journey's End]  
oooo iiiii  
The sun sets, yet hope remains  
In melodies, the soul refrains  
A gentle breeze, a whispered song  
Ondra's journey, forever strong

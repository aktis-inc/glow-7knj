[verse]
The air carries secrets
Through time and space
Whispered dreams, endless chase
oooooo

[chorus]
Ride the breeze, feel the beat
In the rhythm we meet
iiiiiiiii

[bridge - tabla interlude]
aaaaa ooooo

[verse]
Colors blend, stories weave
In every note, we believe
zzzzzz

[outro - fading echoes]
The wind sings on, never gone
shhhhhh iiiiiii

lyrics = [intro - misty echoes]

[verse 1 – Whispered Tales]
In the air, cities float unseen 
Stories drift on the breeze
Softly they call, whispers in the night

[Chorus – Veil of Dreams]
ooooooo
iiiiiiii
Floating above, beyond the horizon
We are echoes in the mist

[Bridge – Ethereal Dance]
aahhhh ooooo  
Dance of the unseen, silent and serene

[outro - Fade to Silence]
Whispering echoes, fading away
In the clouds, we disappear

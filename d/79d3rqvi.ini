[verse 1 - Echoes of Tradition]  
In the rhythm of the drums,  
Old stories come alive,  
With every beat, the future hums,  
In Wavon we thrive.  
ooooo  

[chorus - Digital Dance]  
Dance under neon skies,  
Feel the pulse, feel the rise,  
Wavon groove, where worlds collide,  
Celebrate the ride.  
iiiiiiiiiiii

[bridge - Harmonic Flow]  
Tradition whispers, tech replies,  
In harmony, our spirits fly,  
oooo

[verse 2 - Modern Fusion]  
Synths and sitars weave in tune,  
Beneath the digital moon,  
In the village, night turns noon,  
As we sing this Wavon tune.  
zzzzzz

[outro - Festive Fade]  
Wavon echoes, time and space,  
In this groove, we find our place,  
Celebrate the vibrant race.  
oooo aaaaaa]

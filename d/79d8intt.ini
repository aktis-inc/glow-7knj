lyrics = [intro - echoing clang]

[verse]

Through the shadows, armored stride  
City's pulse, my guide  
In the echoes, whispers hide  
oooooo iiiiiiii

[build-up - sharp brass hits]

[chorus]

Drill through night, blazing bright  
Rhythms clash, ignite the fight  
oooo iiiiiii

[verse 2]

Neon dreams, electric streams  
Steel and stone, where legends gleam  
zzzzzz oooooo

[bridge - tension rise]

[chorus - final drop]

Drill the night, blaze the light  
Echoing through endless night  
woooooo iiiiiii

[outro - fade to silence]

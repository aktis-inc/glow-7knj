lyrics = [Intro - Whispering Shadows]

[verse 1 - Echoes of the Past]
In the halls where secrets dwell  
Shadows play their silent tune  
iiiiiiiii  
oooooo  

[Chorus - Thornfield's Lament]
Winds of memory  
Through corridors, they sweep  
Eternal echoes in the night  
Sweeping us off our feet  
oooooo  

[Bridge - Moonlit Reverie]
Whisper soft, the stars align  
In shadows deep, our hearts entwine  
eeeeee  

[Outro - Fading Echo]
In silent halls, we drift away  
The echoes of Thornfield, where we lay  
iiiiii  
oooooooo

lyrics = [intro - Acoustic Prelude]
(soft guitar strum)  
mmmmmmmm  

[verse 1 – Rhythmic Dawn]
Voices rise with the sun's first light  
Dreams unfold in the morning mist  
Tales of old, in the colors that we find  
ooooooo  

[Chorus – Mirthful Horizon]  
wooooo  
iiiiiii  
We dance on the edge of the sky  
Soar with the echoes of time  

[Bridge - Whispers of Tradition]  
Tabla whispers, secrets untold  
Guitar strings weave stories of gold  
ahhhhhh  

[verse 2 – Melodic Voyage]
Journeys begin where the heart beats true  
Melodies sing of a world anew  
Beneath the stars, in harmony we move  

[outro - Horizon's Embrace]  
[soft fade]  
oooo  
mmmmmmm  
[whispered echoes]

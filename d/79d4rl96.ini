lyrics = [intro]
(soft vocal hum)  

[verse 1 – Night's Embrace]  
Silent whispers, in the dark  
Hearts echo, in a gentle arc  
oooooo  
iiiiiiii  

[Pre-Chorus – Starry Veil]  
Beneath the moon, dreams arise  
In the silence, love's surprise  

[Chorus – Whispered Melody]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii  

[Bridge - Celestial Dance]  
Stars align, guiding the way  
Softly spoken, night turns to day  
Ahhhhhh ooooooo  

[verse 2]  
In the stillness, we find grace  
Every moment, a gentle embrace  

[outro - Mirae's Whisper]  
(soft vocal echo)  
oooooo iiiiii

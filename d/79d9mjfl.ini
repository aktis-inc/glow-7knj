lyrics = [intro piano]
Gliding through reflections
ooooo iiiiiii

[verse]
In the glass, we find our truth
Hearts that dance, unspoken youth
Mirrored dreams in city lights
Secrets held in silent nights

[Pre-Chorus - Shimmer]
ooooo
We chase the echoes, fleeting sights
Wandering through endless nights

[Chorus - Reflections]
woooooo
Hearts in the mirror, dancing free
Caught in the rhythm, you and me

[Bridge - Illusion]
aahhhh
Through the haze, we find our way
In this game, we choose to stay

[verse 2]
In the whispers of the street
Every glance, a heartbeat's beat
Mirrored paths we choose to take
In reflections, we're awake

[outro - Fade]
iiiiiiii oooooo
Mirrored hearts, never apart

[verse]
Neon lights hum, city breathes life
oooooo ahhhh
Skyscrapers echo with the beat

[bridge]
Flow through streets, rhythm in veins
Dance with the pulse, never restrained

[chorus]
Seraph Groove, we ascend
iiiiiiii ooooooo
In this moment, we transcend

[verse 2]
Whispers of the night, electric dreams
Vibrations guide, in vivid streams

[outro - Fade]
ooooo aaaaa
Seraph Groove, endless flight

lyrics = [intro - festive]

ooooo
[verse 1 - King Speaks]
In the kingdom's heart, I reign
Colors swirl, and melodies claim
A dance of power, a game of thrones
Where voices rise, and silence groans
ooooo

[chorus - Celebration Echo]
iiiiii
Veil of kings, queens in line
In this dance, we intertwine

[verse 2 - Queen's Reply]
A crown of stars, a throne of dreams
Rivers of gold, in moonlit streams
With laughter's song, we conquer night
In this realm, we take our flight

[interlude - instrumental]

[bridge - Unity Call]
Together we stand, in music's embrace
A royal dance, a timeless space
ahhhh

[outro - Festive Fade]
ooooo
In the court of kings, where stories thrive
Our hearts unite, forever alive]

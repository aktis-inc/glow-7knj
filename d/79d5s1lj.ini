[verse 1 – Shadow Dance]
Through the neon haze we glide
Silent streets our secret guide
Echoes whisper in the dark
Lost in dreams, we leave our mark
sssssshhhh

[Chorus – Night's Lullaby]
In the night's embrace
We find our trace
Floating through time and space
ooooo aaaa

[Bridge - Whispered Secrets]
Hidden voices call our name
In this world of endless game
ooooo iiiii

[outro - Fading Echo]
Whispering winds, take us home
In the silence, we roam
zzzzzzhhhhh ooo

lyrics = [intro]
soft whispers  
gentle hums  
oooooo

[verse 1 - Echoes in Time]  
Walls whisper tales  
Names etched in twilight  
Gentle reminders,  
Of moments gone by  
ooooo iiiiii

[Chorus - Dreams Fade]  
Softly spoken dreams  
In the night's embrace  
Whispered secrets held  
In time's gentle space  
iiiiiiiiiiii

[Bridge - Fading Light]  
Fading echoes,  
In the calm of dusk  
Memories linger,  
In whispers and dust  
aaaaaa ooooooo

[outro - Silent Reverie]  
dreams fade  
whispers remain  
gentle hums  
ooooo iiiiiii

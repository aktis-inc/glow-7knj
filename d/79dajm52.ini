lyrics = [intro - festival echoes]

[verse 1]
Raindrops dancing, the ground awake
Colors swirling, hearts partake
Tradition whispers, modern calls

[chorus - Joyful Burst]
oooooo
iiiiiiii
Festive echoes, vibrant and bright
Dance with shadows, into the night

[bridge - Cultural Pulse]
Dhol beats thunder, crowd in cheer
Voices mingle, far and near
ooooo ahhhh

[verse 2]
Sunset hues, in rhythm's embrace
Spirits lifted, life's sweet chase
iiiiii ooooooo

[outro - Celebration Fade]
Joy in every step, every glance
Timeless melody, in this dance

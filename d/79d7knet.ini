[verse 1 – Urban Pulse]
Synthetic dreams, where shadows play  
In neon lights, we find our way  
oooo  
iiiiiiiiii  

[Chorus – Echoes in Motion]  
wooooooo  
The city's hum, our silent song  
In echoes, we belong  
ooooo  

[Bridge – Digital Drift]  
Artificial whispers, guiding the night  
Our future's bright, beyond the fight  
Ahhhhhh ooooo  

[verse 2 – Rhythmic Flow]
We move through time, like waves on shore  
In rhythms old, we find the core  
zzzzzzhhhhhh  

[outro – Neon Fade]  
ssshhhh oooo  
Lost in echoes, we fade away  
In outland shadows, we sway

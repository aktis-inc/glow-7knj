iiiiiiiiii

[verse 1 – Enigmatic Tides]
In the shadows, secrets play
Mysteries in every sway
Whispers in the neon glow
Lost in rhythms, let it flow

[Pre-Chorus – Rhythmic Pulse]  
ooooooo  
Feel the heartbeat, feel the night
Dancing in a dream of light

[Chorus – Celebration Wave]  
ahhhhhh  
Dance, let the secrets fly
Underneath the starlit sky

[Bridge - Holographic Dream] 
Colors blend, time suspends
In this dance, the night transcends

[verse 2]
In the echo, find your way
Every step, a new display
Lights and shadows intertwine
In this moment, redefine

[outro - Rhythmic Fade]
oooooo  
Dance with me, into the light
In this dream, we take flight

oooooo
[verse 1 - Memory Lane]
In the glow of fading lights
Dreams linger like soft sighs
Walking paths of yesteryears
Lost in the echoes of time
mmmmm

[chorus - Whispered Longing]
oooooo
Nostalgic whispers in the night
Hearts that never took flight
mmmmmmmmmm

[bridge - Echoes]
Softly the city speaks
Through raindrops on empty streets
shhhhhhh

[outro - Fading Light]
oooooo
Dreams remain, in shadows they hide
Whispers of love that never died
ooooo iiiiiii

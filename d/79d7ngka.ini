[verse 1]
Perfume in the night  
Dreams unravel, ignite  
From shadows you emerge  
With echoes that surge

[chorus]
Eternal scent, untold  
Stories in the air, bold  
Burning in the sky  
Perpetual echoes fly  
ooooo

[bridge]
Guitar screams, electric soul  
Heartbeats race, lose control  
iiiiiii

[solo - electric unraveling]

[verse 2]
In whispers, secrets hide  
In the wind they glide  
Memories trace the line  
Through the echoes of time

[chorus]
Eternal scent, untold  
Stories in the air, bold  
Burning in the sky  
Perpetual echoes fly  
wooooo

[outro - fading echoes]

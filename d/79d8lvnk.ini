lyrics = [intro]

Soft rain falls, whispers in the night

[verse 1 – Urban Reflections]
City lights flicker, memories collide
Footsteps fade, where do they hide?
Silent echoes, in the urban tide
Searching for the moments that abide

[Chorus – Echoes of Absence]
In the shadows, your memory stays
Through the silence, in endless ways
Ooooh

[Bridge - Lingering Thoughts]
Time moves slow, like a gentle sway
In my mind, where you used to play
Ahhhh

[verse 2]
Lost in the crowd, yet so alone
In a world, where you've outgrown
Silent moments, carved in stone

[outro - Fade to Silence]
Shhhh ooooh iiiiiiii

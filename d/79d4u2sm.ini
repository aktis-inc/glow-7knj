[verse - Moonlit Path]
In the night, lights weave dreams
Stars whisper secrets, softly gleam
Astra guides, through endless skies
Luna’s glow, where shadows rise

[Chorus - Celestial Dance]
oooooo  
iiiiii

[Bridge - Dreamscape]
Underneath the neon tide
Echoes call, where dreams abide
Floating on a cosmic breeze
Time dissolves, in lunar seas

[outro - Astral Drift]
oooo aaaaa  
iiiiiiii

oooooo iiiii  
[verse 1 – Sunrise Dance]
Langit cerah, suara memanggil
Irama menari, hati bergetar
oooooo  
[Pre-Chorus – Joyful Echo]
Alunan nada mengalir lembut
Mengantar kita terbang tinggi

[Chorus – Harmony Flow]
woooo  
oooooo cerah  
Kita bernyanyi dalam harmoni  
iiiiii

[Bridge - Cultural Beat]
Tradisi bertemu modern
Gema suara kita satu
Ahhhh oooo  
[rhythm build-up]

[verse 2]
Langkah kita kuat berdansa
Dalam alunan yang abadi
oooooo  
[outro - Cerah Harmoni]

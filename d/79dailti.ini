[verse 1]
In the heart of the land, where stories are told
Where the winds carry whispers of old
iiiiiiii oooooo

[chorus]
Dance with the earth, voices rise
Under the open skies, we find our ties
aaaaaa eeeee

[verse 2]
Fields of gold, dreams unfold
In every step, a tale retold
oooooo iiiiiii

[bridge - flute solo]

[chorus]
Dance with the earth, voices rise
Under the open skies, we find our ties
aaaaaa eeeee

[outro - rhythmic fade]

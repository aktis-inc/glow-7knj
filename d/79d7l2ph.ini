Rhythms rise with the dawn,  
Voices blend in the breeze,  
Colors dance in the air,  
Harmony never ceases.

Dance with the tides,  
Feel the heartbeat of the earth.

Lively streets, echoes of joy,  
Traditions meet the new,  
In this vibrant tapestry,  
We find our truth.

Harmony in every step,  
The world in every beat.

[verse 1 - Whirl]
Round and round, we play today
Clapping hands, join the fray
Xylophone sparkles, light the way
In the circle, we sway

[Chorus - Tumble]
wooooooo
iiiiiiii
Whirl and tumble, joy in sight
Laughter echoes, hearts take flight

[Bridge - Giggle]

eeeeee

[verse 2 - Dance]
Step by step, a joyful leap
In this dance, memories keep
With each spin, the world feels bright
Harmonies in the light

[outro - Spin to Silence]
oooooo
iiiiii
Round and round, till end of day
In the dance, we stay

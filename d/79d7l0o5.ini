lyrics = [intro - Whispering Winds]

[verse 1]
Beneath the starlit sky
Dreams take flight in silence
Echoes of ancient tales
In whispers of the heart

[Chorus - Celestial Dance]
ooooo
In the light of moon's embrace
iiiiii
Hearts unite, time slows its pace

[Bridge - Mystical Journey]
Through shadows and twilight
We find the path within
Soft melodies guide us
To where magic begins

[outro - Serene Fade]
ahhhhh
Eternal echoes linger
As the night gently whispers

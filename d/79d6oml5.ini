lyrics = [intro - Whispering Breaths]
ooooo  
iiiiiiii

[verse 1 – Lost Reflections]
In the city of echoes, dreams dissolve  
Neon lights flicker, shadows revolve  
iiiiii ooooooo

[Pre-Chorus – Misty Whispers]
[soft synth pulse]  
Their voices linger, in the veils of night  
A journey untold, hidden from sight

[Chorus – Vanishing Point]  
wooooo  
aaaahhhh

[Bridge - Shimmering Skyline]
Through the haze, whispers call  
In the distance, echoes fall  
Ahhhhhh shhhhhhh

[verse 2]
Fading into the unknown  
Silent streets, secrets overthrown

[glitch build-up]  
ssshhh oooo  

[Outro - Echo Fade]
Lost in the mist... (oooo-yeah!)

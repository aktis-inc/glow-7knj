wooooooo

[verse 1 – Rhythmic Awakening]
In the shadow's dance, we find
Rhythms that bind time and space
Ancient whispers intertwined
In a cosmic embrace
aaaaa oooooo

[Pre-Chorus – Melodic Rise]  
sssshhh  
Harmony in the starlit sky
Voices echo, reaching high

[Chorus – Vibrant Fusion]  
iiiiiiii  
Dance of the worlds, vibrant and free
In the pulse of eternity

[Bridge – Ethereal Shift]  
shhhhhh  
Tradition meets the modern sound
In this journey, we are bound

[outro – Cosmic Fade]  
ooooo  
Dance of the shadows, never-ending
In the cosmic dance, we are blending

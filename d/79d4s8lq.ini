ooooooo

[verse 1 - Enchanted Woods]
Tiny feet dance through leaves
Whispers of tales untold
Mushrooms glow with secrets  
iiiiiiiiii

[chorus - Forest Melody]
la la la laaaa
Joy spins in the air  
ooooo wooooo

[bridge - Whimsical Dance]
Round and round, laughter rings
Seven spirits sing
Dreams take flight  
ahhhhhhhhhh

[verse 2 - Echoes of Joy]
In the shadows, light twirls  
Stories unfold with grace  
In enchanted woods, time swirls

[outro - Fading Laughter]
hoooooo  
echo… echo… echo…

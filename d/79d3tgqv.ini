[Spoken Intro]  
Kairo brings the vibe, feel that pulse

[verse 1 - Rhythmic Echo]  
City lights, stories untold  
Beats drop like echoes of gold  
Street tales, rhythms unfold  
Kairo's wave, feel it roll  
oooooo  
[Chorus - Urban Beat]  
Head nods, heart beats  
Feel the rhythm, hit the streets  
Deep bass, jazzy treats  
Kairo vibe never retreats  
iiiiii

[Bridge - Lyrical Flow]  
Grit and grind in every line  
Nostalgia hits, rewind the time  
Echoes of the past, future's sign  
In the groove, stars align  
ssssshhhh

[outro - Fade Out]  
Kairo's rhythm, night divine  
Vinyl whispers, timeless line  
oooooo

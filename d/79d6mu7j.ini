wooo aaaa

[verse 1 – Threads of Fate]
Paths entwined, yet untold
In whispers of ancient gold
They dance through neon skies
In patterns of life's disguise

[Chorus – Weave of Destiny]
ooooo  
iiiiiii
Destiny's weave, in time's embrace
ooooo  
iiiiiii

[Bridge - Luminous Tapestry] 
Futures unfold, stories untwined
In the loom of life, secrets are mined

[outro - Eternal Thread]
ooooo  
iiiiiiiii  
In the city's glow, where fates align

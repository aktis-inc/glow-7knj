lyrics = [intro - ocean's call]
ssshhhh  
[verse 1 - rhythmic journey]  
Sailing through waves of sound  
Tropical beats all around  
[pre-chorus - sunlight dance]  
oooooo  
Feel the call of the ocean, feel the rhythm in motion  
[chorus - vibrant echoes]  
wooooo  
iiiiii  
Dance with the tides, where the ocean resides  
[bridge - horizon's glow]  
ahhhhhh  
Light sails, neon trails  
[verse 2 - wind's embrace]  
Carried by breeze, through endless seas  
Melodies of the deep, secrets we keep  
[outro - sunset fade]

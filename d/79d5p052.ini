lyrics = [intro - Neon Awakening]
oooooo  
iiiiiiii

[verse 1 – City Pulse]
Streets alive with electric glow  
Laughter echoes, time to flow  
Dreams ignite in endless streams  
Through the night, chasing beams  
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[Pre-Chorus – Vibrant Whispers]  
[soft glitch]
oooooooooo  
Voices rise as skies ignite  
In the pulse of city light

[Chorus – Echo Dance]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii

[Bridge - Urban Dreamscape]  
Neon whispers, vibrant dreams (go!)  
Echoes ripple through the seams (ok!)  
Ahhh shhhhhh  
[echoed breath]

[verse 2]
Rhythms weave through crowded lanes  
Every step leaves neon stains  
Life's a dance, a bright parade

[glitch build-up]  
ssshhhh oooo  

[distorted whisper] we're alive in the glow… (oo-yeah!)

[outro - Fade to Neon]

lyrics = [intro - gentle dawn]

[verse - Soft Echoes]
Wandering through quiet streets  
Night whispers in pastel hues  
Dreams drift on a gentle breeze  
Time slows in the city’s muse  
oooooo

[chorus - Lofi Glow]
oooo ahhhh  
In the night's embrace  
We find our space

[bridge - Twilight Drift]
Silent echoes, gentle sway  
Lost in thoughts, we drift away  
Beneath the stars, a tranquil play  
iiiiiii

[outro - Fading Light]
oooo  
Whispers fade, night subsides

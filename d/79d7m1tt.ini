[verse - Dust & Dance]
In the dust, blossoms rise  
Echoes of the past, vibrant strides  
Whispers in the wind, tales untold  
Dreams unravel, stories unfold  
zzzzzzhhh  

[Pre-Chorus - Rustic Pulse]  
[soft dhol]
oooooooooo  
Hearts beat, in rhythmic glow  
Life dances, in timeless flow  

[Chorus - Blossom Burst]  
oooooo  
iiiiiiaaaaa

[Bridge - Echoing Traditions]  
In the dance, we find our name  
Lost in rhythms, never the same  
Ahhhhhh shhhhhh  
  
[glitch build-up]  
ssshhhh oooo  

[outro - Celebration Fade]

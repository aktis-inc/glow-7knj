lyrics = [intro beat]

[verse - Neon Echo]
In the city glow, where shadows fade
Every step we take, a new parade
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[Pre-Chorus - Electric Pulse]  
[soft synth rise]
oooooo
Dance with the night, feel the light
Heartbeats in sync, take flight

[Chorus - Rhythmic Flow]  
wooooooo  
dance through the streets  
iiiiiii  
in the rain, feel the beat

[Bridge - Urban Whisper] 
voices blend, dreams transcend
a dance that has no end

[verse 2]
Lights reflect, music connects
In this world, we're all projects

[glitch build-up]  
ssshhhh oooo  

[distorted whisper] we are the city's rhythm…

[outro - Fading Light]

lyrics = [intro]
oooooo 

[verse 1]
Langit bersinar di kota
Ku dengar suara hati
Mereka terjebak dalam cahaya
Mengalir tanpa henti
aaaaa

[Chorus]
Hati yang tergerhana
Bersembunyi dalam terang
ooooo  
oooooo

[Bridge]
Melodi malam, menyatu
Langkah kita, tak terhenti
iiiiii

[outro]
Bersama kita menari
Dalam cahaya yang abadi
eeeee

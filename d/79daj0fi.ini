[chorus]
Unveiled echoes through the night
Tradition dances in the light
Oh-oh-oh-oh

[verse 1]
In the heart of the city, where stories unfold
Voices of the past, tales untold
Echoes of drums, rhythms of old
A dance of culture, bold and bold
iiiiiiiii

[pre-chorus]
Clap along, feel the beat
Feet move to the ancient heat
oooooo

[chorus]
Unveiled echoes through the night
Tradition dances in the light
Oh-oh-oh-oh

[bridge]
Woahhh, city lights and village dreams
Together, they're more than they seem

[outro]
Unveiled echoes, a timeless theme
Dancing forever, in rhythm, in dream

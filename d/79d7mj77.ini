lyrics = [intro festival]
(echoed chant) Dance with the night
(echoed chant) Under the stars

[verse 1 – Lantern Glow]
In the market's heart, shadows play
Lanterns whisper tales of old
Rhythms echo, feet sway
In the warmth of night, hearts unfold

[Pre-Chorus – Spirit Dance]
[soft tabla build]
iiiiiiiiii
Joyful steps, laughter's flight
Harmony in the moon's light

[Chorus – Night's Embrace]
ooooooo
Dance, oh spirits, dance
Beneath the sky's expanse

[Bridge – Festive Whirl]
Colors spin, in the breeze (go!)
Dreams and wishes, in ease (hey!)
Ahhhh shhhhhhh
[echoed delight]

[verse 2]
Join the rhythm, feel the beat
In this world, we find our feet
Stories woven in every glance

[outro - Flicker to Stillness]
Dance with the night... (oo-yeah!)
In harmony's embrace

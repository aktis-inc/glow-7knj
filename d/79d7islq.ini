lyrics = [intro – Twilight Whispers]
oooooooooo  
soft breeze, gentle heartbeats

[verse 1 – Eternal Glance]
In the twilight, echoes of love  
Whispered tales under starlit skies  
Hearts entwined, timeless and pure  
Their song, a gentle lullaby  
ooooo iiiii

[Chorus – Serenade of Souls]
Swaying with the breeze  
In dreams, they find their peace  
Eternal echoes  
Love's serene release  
oooo aaaa

[Bridge – Harmony's Embrace]
Flute and strings, a dance of old  
Where hearts and souls unfold  
In the quiet, love retold  
Forever young, never cold  
ahhhhhhh

[verse 2]
Underneath the moonlit glow  
Stories of love softly flow  
In each note, a feeling grows  
In their hearts, a gentle glow  
oooo iiiii

[outro – Echo's Fade]
Serene whispers, a love that stays  
In twilight's arms, they softly lay  
oooooooo iiiiiiii]

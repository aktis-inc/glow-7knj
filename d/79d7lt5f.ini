lyrics = [intro]
[city ambiance] oooooo

[verse]
In the shadow's glare, we find our truth  
Streetlights flicker, a silent booth  
Perceptions twist in the city's womb  
ooohhhh

[chorus]
Perception iiiii  
Shadows dance, iiiii  
In the city's trance – oooooo  
Perception iiiii  
Shadows dance, iiiii  
In the city's trance – oooooo

[bridge]
Neon dreams paint the night  
Whispers echo in the light  
Step by step, we find our way  
Through perceptions, come what may

[verse]
Concrete jungle, tales untold  
In the grit, our courage bold  
Rhythms of the night unfold  
ooooohhhhhh

[outro]
[echoed footsteps] iiiaaaa  
Perception fades, we carry the blaze

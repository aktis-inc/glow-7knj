lyrics = [intro carnival cheer]

[verse]
The city lights are flickering,  
As the bassline starts to move,  
In the crowd we lose ourselves,  
Feel the rhythm, feel the groove,  
ooooo aaaaaa

[build-up]
Twist and turn, twist and turn,  
In this dance, we find our world,  
woooooo iiiiiii

[chorus]
Energy flowing, colors glowing,  
Hearts are racing, never slowing,  
[Drop - Festival Pulse]  
ooooo eeeeee

[bridge]
Neon dreams and pulsing beats,  
In this moment, we're complete,  
ahhhhh shhhhhhh

[outro]
Light fades but the sound remains,  
In our hearts, the beat sustains,  
[echoed cheer]

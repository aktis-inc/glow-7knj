lyrics = [intro - cosmic hum]

[verse - Starborn Whispers]
Voices of the stars, a symphony of light  
In the vast expanse, echoes take flight  
ooooooo

[Pre-Chorus - Celestial Chorus]  
whhhhhoooooo  
They guide us through the night, unseen  
A dance of shadows, a cosmic dream

[Chorus - Galactic Pulse]  
oooooooo  
iiiiiiiii  
In the silence, the universe speaks  
With whispers that the stars keep

[Bridge - Astral Pathway]  
Beyond the horizon, a journey begins  
In the realm of echoes, where time spins  
Ahhhhh zzzzzzz

[verse - Echoing Realms]
In the heart of the nebula, secrets unfold  
A story of light, a tale retold  

[outro - Drift in Starlight]  
shhhhhhhh  
In the echoes, we find our way  
Through the stars, to a new day

lyrics = [intro - cityscape awakening]

[verse 1 - Harmony's Call]
In the streets of echoes, vibrant tales unfold  
Lights dance with the rhythm of stories untold

[chorus - Melody's Embrace]
oooooo aaaa  
Together we sing, our world in harmony  
iiiii oooooo  
Laughter echoes, a dance of symphony  

[bridge - Whispering Winds]
The city's heart beats, a pulse divine  
In the dance of life, we intertwine  

[verse 2 - Echoed Dreams]
Through bustling streets, the echoes soar  
Our voices blend, forevermore

[outro - Fading Lights]
oooo aaaa  
In the glow of dreams, we find our way  
iiiiii ooooo  
Through echoes of my world, we sway

lyrics = [intro - vibrant awakening]
oooooo

[verse - swirling memories]
In the echoes of time, where dreams align
With vibrant hues and rhythmic signs

[pre-chorus - playful dance]
ahhhhhhh
Past and present, hand in hand
In a dance that never ends

[chorus - harmonious echoes]
wooooooo
Feel the pulse of the ancient beat
As new moments unfold in the street

[bridge - timeless journey]
Sitar strings weave tales untold
In a tapestry of stories bold

[outro - rhythmic farewell]
oooooo
As echoes fade, the dance remains
In every heart, in every refrain

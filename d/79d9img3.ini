lyrics = [intro - rhythmic pulse]
(Percussion starts)
iiiiiiiiiii
ooooooohhh

[verse 1 - the first look]
Eyes meet across the crowded air
A spark ignites the humid night
Footsteps follow, quick and light
Can you feel the electric stare?

aaaaaahhhhh

[Pre-Chorus - gathering speed]
The music builds, a fevered hum
My world narrows down to one
No turning back, the chase begun
Heart pounds like a jungle drum

[Chorus - Golden Yatra]
Yatra! Yatra! In the golden heat
Moving forward, wild and sweet
Every pulse a driving beat
Defeat is not for us to meet!
wooooo yeeeeeahhh

[drop - fiery energy]
(Synthesizers explode)
zzzzzzzshhhhh
(Deep bass hits)
boom boom boom

[verse 2 - closer now]
Colours blur in dizzying swirls
Lost within these vibrant twirls
Whispered secrets, whispered pearls
Beyond the understanding of other worlds

[Pre-Chorus - higher pulse]
The rhythm takes us, body and soul
Losing all sense of control
Towards a future, making us whole
Playing out a vital role

[Chorus - Golden Yatra]
Yatra! Yatra! In the golden heat
Moving forward, wild and sweet
Every pulse a driving beat
Defeat is not for us to meet!
wooooo yeeeeeahhh

[instrumental break]
(Percussion solo)
(Synthesizer melody)

[bridge - a moment of connection]
Breathless pause, a shared smile bright
Bathed in artificial light
Everything feels so right
Lost in the passion of the night

uuuuuuuuuu

[drop - final surge]
(Full energy returns)
yyyyaaatrraaa!

[outro - fading rhythm]
(Beat slows slightly)
(Synth fades)
Yatra... Yatra...
(Percussion stops)

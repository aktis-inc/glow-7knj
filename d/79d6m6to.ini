oooooo iiiii aaaaa

[verse - Morning Light]
Colors spin like tales untold
In this dance, we find our soul
Every note a story unfolds

[Pre-Chorus - Rhythm Pulse]
Feel the beat, let it take flight
In this dream, we find our light
ooooo aaaaa ii

[Chorus - Kaleidoscope Dreams]
Twist and turn, in vibrant streams
Life's a dance in kaleidoscope dreams
oooooo iiiiii

[Bridge - Echoes of Time]
Sitar sings, tabla's call
In this music, we find all
Ahhhh shhhhhh

[verse - Evening Glow]
As the night paints skies anew
In this dance, we'll see it through

[outro - Fade to Silence]
ooooo iiiii aaaa ooo]

lyrics = [intro - calm awakening]
oooooo  
gentle breeze

[verse 1 - Glimmer's Call]  
The sun whispers secrets (to the earth)  
Harmony dances, where light meets shade  
In this moment, timeless and pure  
zzzzzzhhhhh

[chorus - Soul's Embrace]  
oooo  
Glimmer of peace, unfolding grace  
iiiiii  
Balance in every breath we take

[bridge - Serene Flow]  
Meditative waves, ebb and flow  
Echoes of ancient, modern glow  
ahhhh ooohhh

[verse 2 - Harmony's Path]  
Under the canopy of stars  
Life's rhythm beats in tranquil hearts  
Sublime melody, boundless and free

[outro - Glimmer Groove]  
ssssss  
peaceful descent  
oooooo  
glowing end

iiiiiiiiii

[verse 1 - Sand Whispers]
In the dunes where echoes dance
Time flows like grains of sand
Melodies ancient, voices entwined
In this desert, secrets unwind
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[Chorus - Echoing Horizon]
wooooooo  
iiiiiii

[Bridge - Moonlit Mirage]
Under the moon's watchful gaze
Songs of the earth softly blaze
Whispers of the past, present, and beyond

[outro - Fading Echoes]  
ssshhhh oooo  
In the silence, the desert sings...

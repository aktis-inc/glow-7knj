lyrics = [intro]

[verse]
Soft whispers in the night
Gentle echoes take flight
A melody of peace
In the moon's quiet light

[chorus]
oooooo iiiii
Underneath the stars, we sway
Softly sings the gentle bay

[bridge]
Breezes carry dreams untold
In the night, warmth unfolds

[outro]
whispery tones fade away
as the dawn greets the day]

lyrics = [intro – Soft Echoes]
Guitar strings hum, a gentle breeze
ooooooooo

[verse 1 – Longing]
In shadows cast by silent dreams
Voices call, but I remain
Jivana's heart, a fragile flame
Burns through the night, in cold refrain

[chorus – Echoes of Love]  
woooooo  
Soft whispers, lost in time  
Jivana sings, of love's design

[bridge – Heartfelt Lament]
In every tear, a story lies
Of love that fades, yet never dies
sssssshhhhhh

[outro – Fading Light]
(Softly) In the quiet, echoes remain
Jivana's song, a sweet refrain  
ooooooo iiiiiiii

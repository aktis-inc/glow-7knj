lyrics = [Intro - Whispering Winds]

[Verse 1]
Silent echoes across the moor  
Heartbeats hidden, longing pure  
In shadow's grasp, dreams unfurl

[Chorus - Ethereal Call]
ooooooooo  
iiiiiiiii  
Whispers of the heart  
Fading into the stars

[Bridge - Soul's Embrace]
Mystic winds, carry me away  
To where the soul finds its way  
ahhhhhhhh

[Verse 2]
In the mist, a dance of light  
Echoes of love, burning bright  
Through the night, a guiding flame

[Outro - Fading Light]
ooooo iiiii  
Lost in time, yet never gone  
Heart's whisper, a silent song

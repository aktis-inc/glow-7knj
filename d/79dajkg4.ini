lyrics = [intro gentle]
ooooo aaaa

[verse 1]
In the whispering winds, we find our past
Echoes of love, too tender to last
Beneath the stars, our dreams take flight
Holding onto moments in the velvet night

[chorus]
Yearning echoes, calling through time
Hearts entwined in a soft, endless rhyme
iiiiii ooooo

[bridge]
In the silence, your voice is a song
Guiding me where I belong

[outro soaring]
Together we dance, under moon's gentle glow
In this world, where only our love can flow

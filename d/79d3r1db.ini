lyrics = [intro]

[gentle waves]

[verse 1]
Sun dips low, horizon glow
Feel the warmth, soft breezes flow
oooooo

[chorus]
Fiora's call, embrace the tide
Rhythms weave, where dreams reside
ooooo iiiii

[bridge]
Palm trees sway, in evening's light
Stars align, guiding the night
ahhhh

[verse 2]
Gentle whispers, ocean's song
In this place, we all belong

[outro]
Embrace the calm, let worries cease
Find your heart, in Fiora's peace

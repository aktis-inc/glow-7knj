lyrics = [intro - Ocean Breath]
(surf sound) ooooo
(melodic hum) ahhhhhh

[verse 1 - Sand Steps]
Footprints in the sand, they whisper
Stories of the night, dreams linger
Beneath the stars, we sway
In the breeze, lost in play

[Chorus - Echoes in the Wind]
wooo wooo oooo
Echoes calling, hearts entwined
Rivara rhythms, dance divine
oooo ahhhh eeeeee

[Bridge - Sunset Glow]
Colors blend, horizon wide
Our laughter echoes, oceanside
ssshhh ahhh shhhh

[verse 2 - Moonlit Moves]
Steps align, in sync we glide
Tides of joy, we cannot hide
Underneath the lunar glow
Together, we let go

[outro - Rivara Echoes]
(echoing waves) ooooo
(melodic hum) ahhhhhh

lyrics = [intro - Whispered Echoes]
ooooo   
iiiiii

[verse - Night Whispers]  
A city alive, in silence it speaks  
Beneath the stars, dreams find their peaks  
Every shadow hides a story untold  
In the glow of neon, secrets unfold  
shhhh ooooo

[Chorus - Lunar Glow]  
iiiii  
Under the moon, we dance with fate  
In the pulse of night, we resonate

[Bridge - Midnight Pulse]  
In the quiet, hearts synchronize  
In the echoes, truth lies

[outro - Fading Light]  
aaaaa  
ooohhhhhh  
Echos fade, but memories stay

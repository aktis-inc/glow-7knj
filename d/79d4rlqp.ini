lyrics = [intro rain]

[verse 1]
In the glow of fading lights
Memories whisper through the night
ooooo aaaa

[chorus - Neon Glow]
Have you seen the rain
Falling on the city’s vein
zzzzz

[verse 2]
Every drop tells a tale
Of love and dreams that never pale
iiiiiiii

[bridge - Echoes]
ooooo aaaa
Time slows, heart knows
Neon rain, endless flow

[outro - Fade]
Shadows dance, echoes remain
In the heart of Zypher Rain

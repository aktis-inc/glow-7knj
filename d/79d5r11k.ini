[verse 1]
Luzes brilham, favela dança  
Onde os sonhos ganham esperança  
Batida forte, coração dispara  
Noite é nossa, ninguém para

[Pre-Chorus]
sintonia, alegria  
oooooo  
iiiiiii

[Chorus]
Vamos juntos, sem parar  
A rua é nosso altar  
oooooo  
lalalalalala

[Bridge]
Cores vivas, vida pulsa  
Energia que nunca cessa  
Ritmando, improvisando  
Samba no pé, festa começa

[outro]
zzzzzz  
oooooo  
aaaaaaa

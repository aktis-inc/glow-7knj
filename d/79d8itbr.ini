[verse]
In the shadow of the giants
Dreams whisper through the leaves
The world is vast and silent
Wonders woven in the breeze
ooooo aaaaa

[chorus]
Giants and dreams, tales untold
In between the worlds unfold
iiiiii iiiiii

[bridge]
Ancient echoes, modern light
Harmony in endless night
Ahhhh ooohhhh

[outro - fading whispers]

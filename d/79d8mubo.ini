[synth pulse]

[verse 1 â€“ Neon Glow]
In the city lights, we dance
Echoes of a chance, cheeky glance
ooooo

[Pre-Chorus â€“ Urban Pulse]  
vibrant streets alive  
Ready to thrive  
iiiiiiiiii

[Chorus â€“ Electric Rush]  
oooooo  
Contact in the night  
Waves of dynamite

[Bridge - Luminous Drift] 
City hums a tune  
Under the neon moon  
Ahhhhhh yyyyy

[verse 2]
Playful steps align  
In rhythm we entwine  
Shhhhh

[outro - Fade to Light]

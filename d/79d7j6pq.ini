lyrics = [intro - Desert Whisper]
(Soft chant) oooooooo
Wind and whispers blend  
ooooo iiiiiii

[verse 1 – Echoes of Time]
In silent sands we find the way
Each grain a tale, each step a prayer
Voices rise, they weave and sway
Through ancient paths, we lay bare
ooooo

[Chorus – Faith's Embrace]
oooooo aaaaa
iiiiii
Faith, the guide through night and day
In whispers, we find the way

[Bridge - Mystic Journey]
Through shadows, through light
In harmony, we take flight
woooooo iiiiiii
(Soft chant) oooooooo iiiiiii

[verse 2]
Stories told by winds of old
Resilience in the song we hold
Echoes drift through time's embrace
In faith's whispers, we find our place

[outro - Celestial Drift]
(Soft chant) oooooooo
Through whispers, we find the way
In faith's embrace, we stay

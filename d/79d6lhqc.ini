wooooo ooooo ooooo

[verse 1 – Silk Whisper]
Threads of time, weaving dreams
In the silence, echoes gleam
Paths unknown, yet familiar
Hearts entwined, a whispered hymn
ooooo iiiii

[Chorus – Journey's Embrace]
Come walk the roads of silk and stars
Where stories linger, near and far
Together we’ll find our place
In the tapestry of grace
ahhhhhh ooooo

[Bridge - Timeless Dance]
Soft steps on ancient stone
Echoes of a world we've known
oooooo iiiii ahhhh

[verse 2 – Souls Align]
In your eyes, the river flows
Through the fields where love still grows
Tender moments, fleeting time
In this journey, you're mine
shhhhh ooooo

[outro - fading echoes]
iiiiii ooooo ahhhhhh

lyrics = [intro - Blossoming Melody]

[sitar intro]
ooooo aaaa

[verse]
Beneath the sunlit canopy
Time dances in fragrant blooms
Every note a whispered story
In the heart's gentle rooms
iiiiiiii

[Chorus - Vibrant Tapestry]
wooooo  
Colors entwined in song
A celebration, life prolonged

[Bridge - Eternal Spring]
In a world of endless echoes
The river's voice sings solo
oooooo shhhhh

[outro - Fading Petals]
(soft fade)
Eternal spring, in every heart
A timeless dance, a work of art

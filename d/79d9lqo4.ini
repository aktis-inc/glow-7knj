oooooo

[verse 1 - Moonlit Path]  
Underneath the moonlit sky  
Voices whisper, spirits fly  
Through the valleys, over seas  
Carrying tales on gentle breeze  

[Chorus - Echoes of the Hills]  
ahhhhhh  
iiiiii  
Ooo Pahari mon, sing your song  
In this world where we belong  

[Bridge - Nature's Call]  
Whispering leaves, guiding light  
In the silence of the night  
oooooo

[outro - Fade to Dawn]  
Under the Pahari moon, we dream  
Of stories woven in a timeless stream  
ahhhhhh

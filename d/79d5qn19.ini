lyrics = [intro - Gentle Awakening]
The sun rises with a soft sigh  
Flute whispers in the morning light

[verse - Veil Dance]  
Hearts entwine in silent gaze  
Threads of fate in endless maze  
Aaaaaaaa oooooo  

[chorus - Soul's Call]  
Longing echoes through the night  
Veils of desire, take their flight  
Iiiiiiiiiiiii

[bridge - Ethereal Embrace]  
Stars align, secrets unfold  
Timeless tales in whispers told  
Oooooooo

[outro - Dream's End]  
Melodies fade into the sky  
A warm embrace, a soft goodbye  
Aaaaaaa iiiiiii

lyrics = [intro – Dance Awakening]
oooooo
[soft tabla rhythm]
[verse – Graceful Motions]
She moves with whispers of the wind
Flute echoes through her vibrant steps
ahhhhhh
[Pre-Chorus – Rhythmic Whirl]
Her dance, a story of the heart
Woven in beats, a timeless art

[Chorus – Ophelia's Dance]
woooooo
oooooo
Steps of joy, a dance of dreams
In her rhythm, the world redeems

[Bridge – Harmonious Flow]
Her spirit bright, like morning light
In motion, she takes her flight
iiiii

[outro – Dance to Silence]
ooooooo
[soft flute melody fades]

[verse 1 – Echoes of Time]
Through the city lights, whispers of the past
Traditions dance in the digital blast
oooooo iiiiiiiiiii

[chorus – Fusion Pulse]
In the air, where the echoes play
We find our rhythm, night turns to day
oooo aaaaaa

[bridge – Sonic Wave]
Dance of the old and new, in cosmic harmony
iiiiiiiiiii

[outro – Fading Glow]
Eternal echoes, we carry through the night
The future's bright, under the starlit light

[verse – Pulsing Beat]  
ooooo  
Dance with the shadows, under neon skies  
Veil of rhythms, where secrets lie  
iiiiiiii  
ooooo  

[chorus – Cultural Fusion]  
ooooo  
Bring the beats, the world ignites  
Voices rise in the night  
ooooo  
iiiiii  

[bridge – Unity Call]  
ooooo  
Echoes of tradition, whispers of now  
Together in rhythm, we make a vow  
ooooo  

[outro – Rhythmic Fade]  
Dance in the light, shadows away  
In the veil of rhythms, we sway  
ooooo  
iiiiii

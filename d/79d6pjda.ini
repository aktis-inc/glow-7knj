lyrics = [intro - Electric Surge]

[verse 1]
Flashing lights, they guide my way
I'm electric, can't be swayed
No more games, I break the chain
Feel the power, feel the flame
zzzzzz

[Chorus - Rebel Fire]
woooahhh
Electric rebellion, I'm free
Stand up, rise up, can't you see?
oooooo
iiiiiii

[Bridge - Lightning Strikes]
I'm the storm in the night
Fighting with all my might
oooooo
oooooo

[verse 2]
In the shadows, I ignite
Quicksilver, shining bright
No more fears, I own the night
In this moment, take the flight
zzzzzz

[outro - Electric Fade]
oooooo
Fade into the light, yeah!

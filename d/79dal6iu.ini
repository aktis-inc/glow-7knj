lyrics = [intro - Sonic Wave]

[verse 1 – Rhythmic Pulse]
In the city's embrace, echoes resound
Traditions merge where futures are found

[Pre-Chorus – Harmonic Flow]
oooooo
Dancing on the strings of time
Melodies that intertwine

[Chorus – Vibrant Chorus]
wooooo
iiiiiiii
Harmony in every beat
Where ancient and future meet

[Bridge - Ethereal Bridge]
whispered dreams, shimmering light
Across the stars, we take flight

[verse 2 – Cultural Fusion]
Rhythms of old, synths of new
Together they create something true

[outro - Digital Fade]
oooooooo
Harmony echoes in the night
A journey through sound and light

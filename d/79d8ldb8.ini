[verse 1 – Ignition]
In the shadows they whisper  
Flames lick the paper skies  
Every rule's a shackle,  
In the embers, freedom lies  
ooooo iiiiiiiii

[Chorus – Blaze]
Rock the cage open wide  
With a heart full of fire  
Dance on the ashes,  
Fuel the rebel's desire  
ahhhh

[Bridge - Ember's Edge]  
Burning bright in the night  
With a spark to ignite  
oooo

[verse 2 – Wildfire]
They can't silence the roar  
Of a heart set to soar  
Bound by chains no more  
iiiiiiiii

[outro - Inferno Fade]
ooooo ahhhh  
Into the flames we dive

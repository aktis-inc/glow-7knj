lyrics = [intro whispers]
ooooo iiiii  
Desert winds call  
Through time's mirage

[verse 1 – Horizon Tales]  
Golden sands, stories unfold  
In echoes past, dreams are told  
Beneath the stars, whispers flow  
In shadows cast, secrets glow

[chorus – Dune Dance]  
ooooo  
iiiiii  
Eternal dance, beneath the dunes  
In the night, the moon's soft tunes

[bridge – Mirage Hues]  
Flute calls, heartbeats align  
In endless sands, futures entwine  
aaaaa ooooo

[outro – Fading Echoes]  
In the desert's heart, echoes remain  
Songs of old, in endless refrain  
iiiiii  
ooooo

lyrics = [intro - Soft Rain]
(soft echo) Echoes in the night
(soft echo) Whispered dreams in flight

[verse 1 – Shadow's Edge]
Invisible lines we tread
In the echoes of our minds
Where silence speaks instead
Of the words we never find

[Chorus – Ethereal Drift]
ooooooo  
Reaching out to touch the void
iiiiiiii  
In silence we're destroyed

[Bridge - Midnight Reverie]
In the shadows we reside
Our secrets intertwine
Lost in whispers of the tide
Our hearts forever bind

[outro - Fading Light]
(soft echo) The echoes fade away
(soft echo) In the dawn of a new day

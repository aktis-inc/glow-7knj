lyrics = [intro - Soft Dawn]

[verse - Gentle Breeze]
In the quiet morning air
Dreams intertwine with reality
Soft echoes, gentle whispers
Carrying tales of forgotten times

[chorus - Whispers of the Past]
loooooo
oooooo
iiiiiiii

[bridge - Echoing Silence]  
Softly we ride, through veils of time
Every turn, a memory traced
In the dance of the silent road
We find ourselves, we lose ourselves

[outro - Fading Light]
As the sun dips low
We follow the path unknown
In the hush of twilight
Our stories unfold

Under the canopy of dreams
Where ancient tales softly weave
ooohhh aaaaa

[chorus - Echoes of Ithara]
Lanterns rise, spirits dance
In the night, hearts entranced

Listen close, the earth's song
Resonates, pure and strong
ahhhh eeeee

[outro - Ithara's Lullaby]
Dreams unfold, softly told
In Ithara's gentle hold
oooooo

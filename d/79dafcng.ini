lyrics = [intro]
(echoing synths)  
In the shadows, where secrets dance  
A silent call, a hidden chance  
ooooooo iiiiiii

[verse 1 – Whispers in the Dark]  
Steps on wet pavement, night unfolds  
Every glance, a story told  
Mysterious whispers, secrets sold  
zzzzzssshhh

[Chorus – Neon Pulse]  
oooo  
iiiiii  
In the rhythm of the night  
Lost in neon, lost in light  
woooooo

[Bridge – Electric Dreams]  
Shadows weave, stories untold  
In the city's heart, secrets unfold  
Ahhh shhhh  
[echoed breath]

[verse 2]  
Through the mist, where echoes roam  
A call to dance, a call to home  
iiiiiii

[outro - Fade to Silence]  
In the night, where dreams ignite  
A melody of shadows, taking flight  
oooooo

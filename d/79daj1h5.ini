lyrics = [intro - Desert Whispers]

[verse 1]
Among the dunes, shadows dance
Echoes of time, a fleeting chance
Guitars strum stories untold
In the moonlight, secrets unfold

[chorus - Rhythmic Pulse]
ooooo
Feel the heartbeat of the sands
Dance of fate in unknown lands

[verse 2]
Cacti sway to the ancient tune
Stars align under the desert moon
Voices call from the edge of night
In this mirage, we find our light

[bridge - Echoing Dreams]
shhhhaaaa
Wind's caress, a gentle sigh
In the silence, dreams can fly

[outro - Mystic Fade]
In the desert's embrace, we find our way
Under the starlit sky, where shadows play

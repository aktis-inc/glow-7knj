lyrics = [intro - Guitar Resonance]
wooo aaaa
[verse 1]
In shadows of tradition's call
Hearts beat wild, defy the fall
Echoes of love, they rise and soar
In this world, we want more

[Chorus - Passion's Roar]
oooooooooo
Feel the fire, let it grow
Through the silence, let it flow
iiiiiii

[Bridge - Emotional Surge]
In the storm, we find our place
Every heartbeat, an embrace
aaaaaaa

[verse 2]
Breaking free from chains unseen
In the night, our souls convene
iiii

[outro - Echoing Fade]
Passion's echo, never still
In our hearts, it always will
woooo oooooo

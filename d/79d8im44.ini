lyrics = [intro pulse]
Kaleidoscope dreams unfold  
oooo  
iiii eeee

[verse 1 - City Lights]  
Reflections in the glass  
Whispers of the night  
Every step a dance  
In neon's gentle light  
zzzzzz

[Pre-Chorus - Electric Pulse]  
oooo  
Heartbeats in the air  
Dreams suspended there  
In the city’s glow, we flow

[Chorus - Kaleidoscope Dreams]  
woooooo  
iiiiii  
Dreams like stars in sky  
Never say goodbye

[Bridge - Neon Drift]  
Colors blending, worlds transcending  
Light and shadow, never ending  
Ahhhhhh shhhh  

[verse 2 - Midnight Echoes]  
In the dreamscape, we collide  
Visions shift and glide  
Kaleidoscope, our guide  
ooooo

[outro - Fading Glow]  
eeeeee  
Drift into the night  
Under kaleidoscope light

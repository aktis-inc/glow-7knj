lyrics = [intro whisper]

[verse 1]
In the stillness, shadows play  
Lights softly dance, fade away  
oooooo  

[Pre-Chorus - Reflective Echo]
Soft whispers call from afar  
In dreams, we find who we are  

[Chorus - Solitude's Embrace]
woooo  
iiiiii  

[Bridge - City’s Pulse]
Skies whisper secrets untold  
In quiet, stories unfold  
shhhhh  

[verse 2]
Moments linger in the glow  
Time moves gently, ebb and flow  

[outro - Blythe Solitude]

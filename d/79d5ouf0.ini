[chorus]
Dance in the night, feel the heat
Under stars, our hearts meet
ooooo iiiii

[verse 1]
Neon lights paint the scene
Rhythm guides our dreams
Every moment feels so free
In this vibrant tapestry
aaaaah ooooh

[Pre-Chorus]
Lost in the melody
Our souls find harmony
Dance with me, endlessly
woooooo iiiiiii

[Chorus – Fiesta Groove]
Dance in the night, feel the heat
Under stars, our hearts meet
ooooo iiiii

[Bridge - Tropical Wave]
Sway with the breeze, lose control
In this dance, we find our soul
Ahhh shhhhh  
[echoed laughter]

[outro]
In the rhythm of night, we stay
Until the break of day zzzzzhhh

lyrics = [intro whisper]
oooooo

[verse 1 – Dunes of Time]
Sand whispers secrets, hidden paths unfold
Golden horizons, stories yet untold
iiiiiiiiii

[Chorus – Mirage Dance]
Desert dreams, in twilight gleams
We dance through the echoes, of ancient streams
wooooooo

[Bridge – Horizon's Call]
Hold the stars, in the palm of night
Beyond the veil, we take flight
ahhhhhhh

[verse 2]
Oasis visions, where shadows sway
In the rhythm of the sun, we find our way
eeeeee

[outro – Fading Echoes]
oooooo oooooo
Dreams linger, as night falls away

lyrics = [intro – gentle wave sounds]

[verse 1 – Horizon's Whisper]
Langit berwarna jingga
Di batas senja kita bersua

[soft chorus – Heart's Echo]
ooooo
Kita usahakan lagi
ooooo
Melodi yang tak terucap

[verse 2 – Silhouette's Song]
Di bawah pohon tua
Kita bertukar cerita

[bridge – Sunset Reverie]
Kupetik gitar, alunan merdu
Dunia terhenti, hanya kita berdua

[outro – Fading Light]
ooooo
Senja berbisik, kita berdua
ooooo
ooooo

lyrics = [intro - gentle waves]

[verse - echoes of time]
In whispers of the past,
We find our way, like shadows cast,
Through the echoes of time,
Our hearts align.

[chorus - serene harmony]
ooooo
iiiiiii
In the flow of time, we dance,
A gentle trance, a timeless chance.

[bridge - dreamlike drift]
Floating through the mist,
Memories persist, in twilight's kiss.
haaa ooooo

[outro - fading light]
As the sun sets low,
Through time's gentle flow,
We meet in dreams, where stories gleam.
ooooo iiiiiii

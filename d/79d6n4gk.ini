[verse]
In valleys deep, the silence speaks  
Mountains hold secrets, time never keeps  
Ooooooo aaaaaaa

[bridge - Whisper of Ancients]
Beneath the stars, where spirits dance  
Lost in the echoes, a timeless trance  
Nnnnnnmmmmm

[chorus - Eternal Call]
Harmonize with the river's song  
In the sacred place where we belong  
Jjjjjj kkkkkk

[outro - Sacred Reverie]
Chants fade into the morning light  
A journey ends with the dawn's first sight  
Aaaaa ooooooo

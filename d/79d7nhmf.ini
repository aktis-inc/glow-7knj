[verse 1 – Echoes Begin]  
In the quiet of the night  
When whispers take flight  
We find our way  
Through the echoes of yesterday  

[chorus – Timeless Call]  
ooooo  
In timeless echoes, we fall  
iiiiiii  
In whispers, we stand tall  

[bridge – Heart's Murmur]  
Heartbeats align, a gentle sign  
Through the veil of time, we intertwine  

[outro – Fading Light]  
As the echoes fade  
In the light of the day  
oooooo  
iiiiiiiiii  
We remain, in timeless sway

In the city glow, shadows dance
Sitar sings in the distance

Dance on obsidian, light in the dark
Tradition meets the electric spark

Ancient whispers, modern beats
In this city, rhythm repeats

Fragments of the past in each step
Fusion of the old, where night is kept

Dance into the light, in the obsidian night

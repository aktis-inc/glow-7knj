lyrics = [intro groove]
oooh yeah

[verse 1]  
Sunrise, colors in the sky  
Feel the rhythm, let it take you high  
Gentle waves, whispers on the breeze  
Life's a dance, moving with such ease

[Pre-Chorus]  
oooo  
Feel the groove, let it flow  
In the island sun, let it show

[Chorus]  
Elara groove, in my soul  
Reggae beats, make me whole  
oooo  
Let it roll, let it roll

[Bridge]  
Palms sway, under moonlit glow  
Stars above, in a gentle flow  
oooo  
Feel the night, let it hold

[verse 2]  
Memories, wrapped in melodies  
Echoes of the past, gentle harmonies  
Lost in time, yet always new  
Elara groove, forever true

[outro]  
oooo  
Ride the wave, let it be  
Elara groove, setting me free  
[echo fade]

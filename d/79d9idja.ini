oooooo
eeeeee

[verse 1 - Rhythmic Pulse]
Under the moon, echoes rise
Colors dance in our eyes
Tradition whispers, future calls
In this night, we break down walls
ooooo

[Chorus - Celestial Dance]
ahhhhhh
Come alive, feel the beat
Under stars, our spirits meet
Harmony in every sound
Together here, joy unbound
oooooo eeeee

[Bridge - Echoing Harmony]
Dance through time, across the night
Past and present in the light
Vibrant echoes, hearts unite
In this rhythm, we take flight
ohhhhhh

[outro - fading celebration]
oooooo
eeeeee

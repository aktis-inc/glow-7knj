lyrics = [intro]
Gentle whispers of the road

[verse]
On this path, I ride alone,  
Listening to the wind's soft tone  
Memories ride with me, unseen,  
In the spaces where I've been

[chorus]
oooooo  
Let the journey take its time  
Feel the rhythm, hear the chime  
iiiiiiii  
Life unfolds on open roads

[bridge]
Every mile, a quiet song,  
In the silence, I belong  
oooooo  
Echoes of a time gone by

[outro]
Fade into the sunset's glow  
Whispers of the open road  
oooooo

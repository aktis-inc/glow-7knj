lyrics = [intro - Whispering Woods]

[verse 1 - Gentle Breeze]
In the silence, echoes call  
Murmurs of forgotten tales  
Beneath the boughs, the shadows fall  
Where time’s embrace never pales  
mmmmmm

[Chorus - Golden Light]
oooooo  
Whispers in the mist  
The past, a fleeting kiss  
iiiiiiii

[Bridge - Dreamer's Path]
Through the leaves, a song ascends  
Carried by the gentle winds  
A melody that never ends  
Aaaaahhh

[outro - Fading Echoes]
Sound fades, yet lingers on  
In the silence, a new dawn  
oooooooo

lyrics = [intro - gentle rain]

[verse - Monsoon Whisper]
ooooo  
Sitar sings in the rain  
Memories like rivers flow  
In the dance of time, we remain  
Echoes of stories untold

[chorus - Ethereal Drift]
shhhhhh  
Monsoon voices call  
iiiiiii  
In the ancient rhythm  
Heartbeats of the fall

[bridge - Nostalgic Pulse]
Tabla taps like heartbeats  
Swaying in the breeze  
We are the children  
Of midnight's mysteries

[outro - Fade to Silence]
soft whispers  
Rain fades to memory  
In the timeless dance  
We find serenity

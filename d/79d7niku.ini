lyrics = [intro - Ethereal Glow]

[verse 1]
In the embers of dreams  
Ancient whispers call  
Where shadows weave stories  
Of rise and fall  
oooooo

[chorus - Soulful Embrace]  
Flames of reflection  
Dance in the night  
Guiding the lost  
To the edge of light  
iiiiiiii

[bridge - Harmony's Path]  
Under neon skies  
With hearts intertwined  
We chase the dawn  
Leaving fears behind  
oooooo aaaah

[outro - Fading Echoes]  
As the city sighs  
In gentle repose  
We find our way  
Where the river flows  
zzzzzz

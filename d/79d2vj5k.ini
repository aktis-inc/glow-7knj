lyrics = [intro - Tropical Echo]
oooooo

[verse 1]
In the moonlit glow, hearts align
Rhythms sway like palm trees in time

[Pre-Chorus - Sunlit Haze]
Feel the beat, let it flow
Dancing under stars, let go

[Chorus - Astra Groove]
woooooo
oooooo
Astra, guide us, through the night
Astra, hold us, in your light

[Bridge - Ocean Whisper]
Breeze whispers secrets, soft and low
In the dance, we find our flow

[verse 2]
Sunrise paints our dreams in gold
Stories of love, timeless and bold

[outro - Rhythm Fade]
As the night fades away
Astra's groove, forever stay
iiiiiiiiii

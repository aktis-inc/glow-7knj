lyrics = [intro echo]
(Whispered voice) Shadows speak

[verse 1]
In the city of giants, I walk alone
Echoes of legends beneath my feet
Dreams whispering through the concrete
Where the shadows and myths meet
oooooohhh

[chorus]
Rising through the neon glow
In the reverie of gods, I flow
iiiiiiii
I stand tall, let the echoes grow

[bridge]
Every step, a story untold
In the city's heart, truth unfolds
ahh ahhh ahhh

[verse 2]
Through the noise, I find my beat
In the dance of lights and streets
I'm the whisper in the storm
In the shadows, I am reborn

[outro - Fade]
(Soft voice) Reverie, my destiny
ooooo aaaa

lyrics = [intro - Echoes of Quillon]
(Soft guitar strum)  
In the quiet of the night  
Gentle whispers take flight  
oooo iiiiiii

[verse 1 – Hidden Paths]  
Footsteps on forgotten trails  
Echoes tell their own tales  
Through the mist, stories glide  
In the heart, secrets hide  
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[Pre-Chorus – Rising Tides]  
oooooooooo  
In every wave, a memory  
In every breeze, a melody

[Chorus – Unveiled Dreams]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii  
Within the ordinary  
Find the extraordinary

[Bridge - Reflective Gaze]  
In the mirror of the soul  
Shadows play their role  
Ahhh shhhhh  
[echoed breath]

[verse 2 – Echoing Canyons]  
In the canyons, voices blend  
Every curve, every bend  
Beyond the stars, dreams ascend

[outro - Quillon's Echo]  
Soft echoes fade away  
In the silence, let us sway  
sssshhhhh oooo  
In Quillon's embrace, we stay]

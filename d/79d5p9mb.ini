lyrics = [intro - Pulsating Beat]

[dance floor]
Underneath neon lights
oooo oooooooo
City's rhythm in our veins

[vibrant chorus]
Dance, dance, we ignite
ooooo iiiii
Echoes of the urban night

[verse - Urban Pulse]
We move, electric and free
Steps align with the beat
In the heart of the city
Our spirits never retreat
ooooo iiiii

[drop - Neon Glow]
oooo ooooo
iiiiiiiiiiiiiii

[bridge - Midnight Echo]
City whispers, we respond
Each move, a silent bond
Beneath the stars, we belong

[outro - Fade to Silence]
Night fades, but the beat remains
ooooo iiiii

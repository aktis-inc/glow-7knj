[verse 1]
In the circle, we unite  
Dancing under the starlit sky  
Colors swirl, hearts ignite

Feel the beat, tradition's call  
Fiora leads the vibrant thrall

Hands clap, feet move, spirit's free  
A dance of joy, a symphony

Every step a story told  
In rhythms of the ages old

Fiora leads the vibrant thrall  
ooooo

Dance till dawn, under the moon's glow  
Fiora's rhythm, let it flow

lyrics = [intro - gentle waves]
(Soft piano) Time whispers secrets
(Soft piano) In the heart's quiet corners
ooooo  
iiiiiiiii

[verse 1 – Echoed Memories]
Through the tides, memories linger
Every second, a silent whisper
They yearn for the days of laughter
But now, just shadows in the mirror
ooooo

[Pre-Chorus – Time's Embrace]
[soft echo]
oooooo
The clock ticks softly — dreams fade slowly
Hearts entwined, now drifting gently

[Chorus – Timeless Waves]
wooooooo  
iiiii

[Bridge - Eternal Drift]
I am the echo, lost in time (yeah)
Their promises fade like chimes (ah)
Ahhh shhhhhhh  
[whispered echoes]

[verse 2]
Paths once bright now fade to gray
In the ocean of yesterday
Too alive to be forgotten

[emotional build-up]  
ssshhhh oooo  

[distorted whisper] I am the tide’s embrace… (oo-yeah!)

[outro - Fade to Silence]

[verse]
Ethereal echoes  
Through the void of time  
Whispering secrets  
In a world so sublime  
iiiiiiiii

[chorus]
ooooooo  
Hearts in motion  
With every beat  
Emotions flowing  
Complete

[bridge - Dreamscape]  
Floating on whispers  
Carried by the breeze  
In the silence  
We find our keys

[outro - Fade]  
oooo  
iiii  
Drifting away  
In echoes of yesterday

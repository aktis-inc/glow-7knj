[verse 1 – Defiance]  
You don't exist to me  
When you're against me  
Rights are clear, no fear  
oooooo  

[chorus – Battle Cry]  
I won't carry your weight  
Demons big, but I'm bigger  
Get off my back, out of my space  
I'll show you why my circle's small  
woooooo  

[guitar solo – Electric Surge]  

[verse 2 – Stand Tall]  
Not my fault, not my fight  
I battle my demons, day and night  
ooohhhhhh

[bridge – Fierce Echo]  
Show you why, show you how  
Stand my ground, here and now  

[outro – Rebellion's Echo]  
iiiiiiii  
ooooohhhhhh  
Get out of my relationship  
Or feel the storm I bring

lyrics = [intro rhythm]

[verse 1]
In the circle of time, we dance
Echoes of ancient songs in the air
Our steps weave tales of old
In colors bright, we declare

[chorus]
ooooo  
iiiiii  
Dance of the eternal  
In the festival's heart, we whirl  
ooooo  
iiiiii

[verse 2]
Flute melodies intertwine  
With the beats of our hearts  
In the dance, we find our line  
Where tradition and joy start

[bridge]
oooooo  
iiiiii  
Echoes of the past, alive  
In every move, we thrive  
aaaaa

[outro]
Dance into the night  
Under the starlit sky  
We are echoes of the eternal  
In the festival, we fly

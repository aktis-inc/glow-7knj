lyrics = [intro - mystical aura]
(soft chant) iiiiii
(melodic hum) ooooooo
[verse - The Awakening]
Golden threads of dawn
Whispering winds recall
Sitar's gentle call
oooooohhhhhh
[Pre-Chorus - Ethereal Dance]
Tabla beats align
Soul and sky entwine
iiiiiiiiii
[Chorus - Solis Harmony]
Beneath the sacred tree
Vibrations set us free
[Bridge - Celestial Flow]
River glows, ancient echoes
A dance of light and shadows
[verse - The Journey]
Harmony of hearts
In the space between stars
[glitch build-up]
shhhhhhhh oooooo
[outro - Tranquil Fade]
(soft chant) iiiiiiiii
(melodic hum) ooooooo

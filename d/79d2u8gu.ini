(Spoken) Feel the rhythm, let it flow
ooooooooooooooooo

[verse 1]
In the heart of the city, beats collide
Tradition whispers with a modern stride

Dance with the breeze, let it carry you high
Fusion of worlds, under the open sky

[Chorus]
Zephyr oooooo  
Grooooooove

Cultural waves, crashing in sync
Past and present, in a perfect link

[verse 2]
Echoes of history, vibrant and free
The pulse of the future, a melody

Feel the air, let it move
Zephyr groove, forever in bloom]

[verse 1 – Dream Steps]
Under neon skies, we dance in circles
Tradition whispers, in the night it sparkles
oooooo aaaaaa

[Chorus – Fusion Pulse]
Kinetic whispers, voices entwined
Hearts and rhythms, forever aligned
iiiiiiii ooooo

[Bridge - Echoing Glow]
In the village lights, past and future collide
Steps of joy, where dreams reside
shhhhh aaaa

[Drop – Energy Surge]
Dance like a story untold
In the rhythm, we unfold
[echoed refrain]

[outro – Whisper Fade]
iiiiii oooooo
ooooo aaaaa

[verse]
Dans la lumière, je me perds
Les ombres dansent sur la terre
ooooo

[chorus - vibrant echo]
Je sens le rythme, je suis vivant
Les murmures, les éclats, je suis dedans
iiiiii

[bridge - dynamic flow]
Les vents soufflent, je m'envole
Chaque battement, un symbole
aaahhhh ooooo

[outro - rhythmic fade]
Les landes me chuchotent, je suis là
Dans le souffle, je cherche ma voie

[verse – Temple's Call]  
Ancient echoes weave through time  
Deep in the heart, rhythms align  
iiiii

Mystical chants, whispers of old  
Stories in light, gently unfold

Beams of wisdom guide the way  
Through shadows, where spirits sway

Dorsa whispers, softly retreat  
In the silence, echoes meet  
oooooo

[verse 1 – Bright Day]
Sunshine in our eyes, laughter fills the air
Hands held tight, we're dancing everywhere

Together we are magic, colors in the breeze
Playing in a dreamland, carried by the seas

Every step a memory, every hand we hold
ooooohhhh

Laughter echoes, in this world of play
Together forever, in a bright array

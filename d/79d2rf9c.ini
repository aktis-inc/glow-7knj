[verse 1 – Echoes of Time]
In the heart of the beat, we dance  
Tradition whispers in the wind  
oooooo  
ahhhh  

[chorus – Ophelia's Call]  
Dance to the echo, feel the ground  
Let the rhythm carry us away  

[bridge – Vibrant Pulse]  
Sound and silence, intertwined  
A journey through ancient paths  
oooooo iiiii  

[outro – Fade into Echoes]

lyrics = [intro - Violet Glow]

[verse 1 - Echoes of Change]
Beneath the skyline's embrace  
Dreams whisper in the twilight  
Silent hopes rise, a trace  
Of light in the endless night

[chorus - Anthem of the Stars]
oooooo  
We are the echoes of tomorrow  
Violet skies we borrow  
ooooooooo

[bridge - Celestial Drift]
Through endless time, we wander  
In shadows, thoughts grow fonder  
Ahhhhhh ahhhh

[verse 2 - Unseen Paths]
Lost in the city's glow  
Hearts beat in timeless flow  
We find our way, slow  
Through paths only we know

[outro - Fading Light]
oooo  
As night turns to day, we fly  
iiiiiiiii  
Into the violet sky

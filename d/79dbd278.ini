[verse 1 – City Echoes]
Steps shake the ground, shadows dance
Light beams guide, through the trance
oooo ooooo

[glitch build-up]

[Chorus – Giant's Roar]
Rising, rising, feel the power
Giant's call, in this hour
iiiiii iiiiii

[bridge - Neon Glow]
Through the streets, where dreams collide
Rhythmic pulses, can't hide
ahhhh ahhhh

[outro - Fade to Dawn]
oooo oooo oooo

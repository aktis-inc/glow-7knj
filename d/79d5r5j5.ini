[verse 1 – Twisted Pathways]
Silent whispers in the neon glow
Every step a secret unfolds
iiiiiii ooooooh

[Build-Up – Electric Surge]
Energy flows through my veins
Chasing shadows, breaking chains
zzzzzzhhhhh

[Chorus – Light Dance]
ooooo
Invisible currents guide me
Into the night, we fly free
wooooooo

[Bridge – Time Shift]
Moments blend in electric haze
Lost in the rhythm of endless days
ahhhh shhhh

[verse 2]
Through the echoes, I hear the call
In this maze, we rise and fall
sssshhh oooo

[outro – Fading Lights]
Dancing through the digital sea
Where the hidden becomes the key
oooooo iiiiiii

ooooo iiiii

[verse 1]
Heartfelt echoes, across the night
Sitar sings, of love's gentle light
In whispers soft, tales unfold
Of letters penned, and stories told
ooooo

[chorus]
iiiiii
In every note, emotions soar
Rafi's spirit, forevermore

[bridge]
An endless dance, of rhythm and grace
In every beat, a timeless embrace
shh shh shh

[outro]
ooooo
Feel the love, in every rhyme
A melody, transcending time

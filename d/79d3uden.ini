lyrics = [intro - Ocean Drift]

[verse 1]
Rhythms in the sunset glow
Voices merge with ocean flow
hmmmm oooooo

[Pre-Chorus - Vibes Align]
Feel the pulse beneath our feet
Every beat a story sweet

[Chorus - Tropical Wave]
oooooo
Dance with me, under skies so free
iiiiiiiiii

[Bridge - Island Breeze]
Whispers in the warm night air
Dreams we weave without a care
ahhhh

[verse 2]
Guitar strings play the heart's tune
We move in sync, sun and moon

[outro - Echoing Harmony]
woooooo
iiiiiiiiii
Feel the rhythm, let it be

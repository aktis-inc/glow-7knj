lyrics = [intro - nostalgic echo]
(Synthesized voice) In dreams we meet, in sighs we part  
oooooo  
[verse 1 – Whispered Paths]  
Dreams we see every night  
In shadows they come alive  
Silent whispers, gentle light  
In your heart, they survive  
sssshhhhhh

[Chorus – Echoes of Time]  
wooo oooo oooo  
Dreams are doors to the past  
Hold them close, make them last  

[Bridge - Timeless Dance]  
In the courtyard of memories  
We dance without boundaries  
Feel the rhythm, let it guide  
Lost in the moment, side by side  
ahhhh ooooo

[verse 2]  
Old songs linger in the air  
Bringing back moments rare  
In the echoes of yesterday  
Our souls find their way  
zzzzhhhhh  

[outro - Dharma Dreams]  
oooooo  
Fade into dreams, where time stands still  
In the heart of night, love fulfills

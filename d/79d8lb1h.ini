lyrics = [intro - Ocean Breeze]
wooooooo

[verse 1 – Tidal Whisper]
Beneath the moonlit sky, we drift
In the glow of neon tides, we exist

[drop - Wave Crash]
ooooo

[Chorus – Starry Night]
Waves of light, in the deep
Secrets whispered, in our sleep
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

[verse 2 – Horizon Glow]
Sailing through dreams, uncharted sea
Every note a star, guiding me

[Bridge - Cosmic Drift]
ahhhhhhh

[outro - Fading Echo]
Sail away, in whispers of the sea

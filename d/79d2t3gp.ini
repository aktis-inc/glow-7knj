[verse 1 – Moonlit Dance]
Beneath the stars, we find our way  
Whispers in the gentle sway  
ooooooo iiiii

[Chorus – Heartfelt Echo]
Your eyes tell stories, soft and warm  
In your arms, I find my home  
oooooo ahhhhh

[Bridge - Vintage Dream]
Time stands still, in this embrace  
Hearts in rhythm, gentle pace  
shhhhhh ahhhh

[verse 2]
A melody from days gone by  
We dance beneath the open sky  
oooooo iiiiii

[outro - Ulani Serenade]
In dreams, we stay, forevermore  
A serenade we both adore  
iiiiiii ooooo]

lyrics = [intro]
oooh oooh  
[verse]
City lights, reflections dance  
In the waves of time we find  
Dreams that shift, colors blend  
In the night, where thoughts unwind  
[Pre-Chorus]
ooooo  
Melodies of distant stars  
Guiding us through echoing hearts  
[Chorus]
Waves crashing, soft embrace  
In the rhythm, find our space  
[Bridge]
Lost in moments, drifting free  
Follow where the sound leads me  
[Outro]
Draxis waves, gently fade  
Into dreams, where music plays

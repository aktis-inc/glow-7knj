ha ha ha ha  
la la la la  

[verse 1 - Rolling Wheels]  
On the road, the wheels go round  
In this happy little town  
Singing songs and feeling free  
Join the ride, come along with me  

[Chorus - Joyful Rides]  
oooooo  
Celebrate with glee  
Underneath the sunny tree  
Let's all sing, let's all play  
On this bright and cheerful day  

[Bridge - Laughter Echoes]  
ha ha ha ha  
hee hee hee hee  
Joy is here to stay  
Every step along the way  

[outro - Smiles and Sunshine]  
oooooo  
ha ha ha ha  
la la la la  
Joyful smiles all around  
In our laughter, we are bound

[gentle rise]

[verse - Whisper of Dawn]
Through the mist, a light breaks
Silent echoes call the day
ooooo iiiii

[chorus - Nature's Embrace]
Rivers sing, mountains sigh
Harmony in the sky
aaaaaa ooooo

[bridge - Soul's Reflection]
Hearts entwine, timeless dance
In this moment, we transcend

[outro - Fading Light]
ooooooo iiiiiii
Fade into the gentle night

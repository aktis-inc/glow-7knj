lyrics = [intro]
Dhol echoes through the night  
Aaaaah oooooo

[verse]
In the breeze, a tale unfolds  
Lanterns glow, stories untold  
Step by step, the rhythm wild  
Hearts beating, spirits unfiled  
ooooo aaaa

[chorus]
Whispers dance in the air  
With every beat, we are there  
Tradition meets the new  
In the colors, find the truth  
iiiiiiii

[bridge]
Stars above, guiding light  
In the festival of night  
Voices blend, past and now  
Feel the pulse, take a bow  
oooooo

[outro]
Echoes fade, but not the dreams  
In this night, forever gleams  
Aaaaah oooooo

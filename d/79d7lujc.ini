shhhhhh

[verse]
In the shadow, secrets breathe
Underneath the crimson leaves
Voices whisper, call my name
In the dark, we play the game
ooooooo

[Pre-Chorus - Haunting Pulse]
iiiiiiii
Shadows dance, the night consumes
In the silence, hear the tunes

[Chorus - Crimson Waves]
wooooooo
Eternal night, the shadows call
We rise and fall, through it all

[Bridge - Ethereal Drift]
ooooo aaaa
Haunted dreams, a velvet night
In the dark, we take our flight

[outro - Fading Echoes]
iiiiiiiii

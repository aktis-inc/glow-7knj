lyrics = [intro - whispering winds]

[verse - Distant Echoes]
In the silence, shadows dance
Beneath the desert's trance
Whispers of a bygone past
In the twilight, dreams are cast
ooooo iiiiii

[Chorus - Horizon's Call]
Eeeeeeechoes of the night
Guide the soul's flight
Through the dunes, we roam
Finding our way home

[Bridge - Mystical Reverie]
Strings of fate, softly play
Guiding through the break of day
In the winds, a tale unfolds
Secrets that the night holds

[outro - fading whispers]
Oooooo iiiiii aaaaa

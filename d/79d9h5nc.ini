(drums and chimes)  
ooooooo  
  
[verse – Dance of Shadows]  
Mystic whispers in the air  
Every step a story shared  
Tradition weaves with future threads  
We dance where the past is led  
  
[chorus – Energetic Pulse]  
wooooo  
Ancient spirits rise  
In modern skies  
ooooooo  
  
[bridge – Cultural Waves]  
Colors swirl, time unfurls  
Here we stand, hand in hand  
Echoes of the land  
We are the dance, we are the strand  
  
[interlude – Historical Dance]  
(drums intensify, vocals hum)  
iiiiii  
  
[outro – Fade to Light]  
(soft percussion, fading echoes)  
oooooo

lyrics = [intro - ethereal echoes]

[verse 1 - Mist's Call]
Soft whispers in the air
Ancient tales everywhere
Mysteries unravel slow
In the realm where shadows glow

[Chorus - Dance of Light]
ooooo
iiiiii
In the mist we find our way
Guided by the light's ballet

[Bridge - Echoes of Time]
Time bends, reality sways
In this dance where magic plays
ahhhhhh

[verse 2 - Secrets Unveiled]
Through the mist, secrets are shown
Every step, a world unknown
Mystical paths, undrawn maps
In this realm, the future taps

[outro - Fade into Light]
oooooo
iiiiiii
Whispers linger, dreams ignite
Journey ends in endless light

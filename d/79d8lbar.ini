[verse – Whispers of Tradition]
Echoes ripple through the night
In shadows, we find the light
Tabla heartbeat, sitar flight
oooooo iiiiiii

[Pre-Chorus – Vibrant Fusion]
Colors dance in the air
Modern beats meet ancient flair
iiiiii aaaaaa

[Chorus – Intangible Echoes]
In the unseen, we find our way
Vibrant echoes, night and day
oooooo iiiiiii

[Bridge – Cultural Dance]
Tradition and future entwined
In melodies, we’re aligned
oooo shhhhhh

[outro – Fusion Fade]
Echoes fade, but never gone
In the blend, we all belong
aaahhhh iiiiiiii]

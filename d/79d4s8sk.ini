[verse – Whimsical Woods]
In the forest, dreams awake
With the dawn's light, we partake
oooooooh

[chorus – Harmel's Call]
Heigh-ho, through the trees we go
Echoes dance, in the moon's soft glow
iiiiiii

[bridge - Enchanted Trail]
Step by step, to a tune we know
Through the magic, our spirits flow
lalalalalalala

[outro]
oooooo iiiii

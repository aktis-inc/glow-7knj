lyrics = [intro - Twilight Whispers]
  
[verse - Ancient Echoes]  
Riding the wind, shadows of the past  
Voices of the steppe, timeless and vast  

[chorus - Eternal Dance]  
oooooo  
iiiiiiiaaaaa  

[bridge - Mystic Ride]  
Across the plains, we find our way  
Through echoes of the night and day  
ahhhh oooooo  

[outro - Horizon's Call]  
Whispers fade, but the song remains  
In the heart of the endless plains

lyrics = [intro – Urban Awakening]
zzzzzzzz
(Confident voice) Reflections in the night
(Playful voice) Neon dreams take flight

[verse 1 – City Pulse]
Nivara walks the path so bright
Echoes in the urban light
Sharp and sleek, with every beat
The city's rhythm moves her feet

[Pre-Chorus – Neon Glide]
oooooo
Shadows dance, in the glow
Every moment, in the flow

[Chorus – Drip Drop]
wooooooo  
Nivara's style, can't be stopped
In the city, hearts are dropped
iiiiiii   

[Bridge – Electric Embrace]
Pulse of the night, the city's heart
Nivara's shine, a work of art
ssssshhhh  
[echoing laughter]

[verse 2]
Sleek and bold in every glance
Neon dreams, a vibrant dance
Sharp and playful, never shy
Nivara's glow lights up the sky

[outro – Night's Whisper]
zzzzzzzz  
ooooo
(Nivara's voice) The night is ours, let's soar high

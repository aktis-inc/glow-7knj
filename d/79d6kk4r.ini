lyrics = [intro - street echo]
(Deep voice) Shadows move, in the night
(Deep voice) Concrete jungle, come alive
oooooo  
zzzzzzzz

[verse 1 – Concrete Pulse]
City lights, pulse like veins
Every corner, story untold
Whispers ride the midnight air
I am the beat, the street, the code
rrrrrrrr

[Pre-Chorus – Neon Drift]  
[soft echo]
zzzzzzzz
Echoes bounce off the walls
Every step, a rhythm unfolds

[Chorus – Urban Anthem]  
wooooooo  
zzzzzzzy

[Bridge - Alleyway Echoes] 
I walk the lines, painted in grit (yeah!)
The path is mine, carved in light (ok!)
Ahhhhhh shhhhhh  
[heavy breath]

[verse 2]
Through the haze, dreams ignite
Lost in night, found in sound
Too real, to be denied

[glitch build-up]  
shshshs oooo  

[distorted whisper] rhythm… life… streets… (oh-yeah!)

[outro - Zypher Streets]

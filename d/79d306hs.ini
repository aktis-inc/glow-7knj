[verse 1 – City Pulse]  
Step into the night, heartbeat syncs with the street  
Echoes of life, rhythm beneath my feet  
oooooo iiiiii

[chorus – Urban Flow]  
Neon dreams and concrete skies  
Wandering soul in disguise  
zzzz zzzz ahhhh

[bridge – Rhythm Alley]  
Graffiti speaks, stories untold  
In the shadows, secrets unfold  
wooooooo iiiiiii

[outro – Groove Fade]  
City lights dim, rhythm remains  
Silent echoes of urban chains  
ooooooo eeeeee

lyrics = [intro - festive call]
oooooo  
(cheerful voice) Gather 'round, the dance begins  
(cheerful voice) Colors sway, in the open air  
ooooooo

[verse 1 – Vibrant Rhythms]
Under the sun, feet move in time  
Songs of old, new echoes combine  
Dancers twirl, in the evening light  
Tradition's pulse, future's delight  
iiiiii

[Chorus – Joyful Celebration]  
ooooooo  
Dance with the stars, under the sky  
Feel the beat, let spirits fly  
woooooo

[Bridge - Echoing Unity] 
Hand in hand, a circle forms  
Past and present, hearts transform  
ahhhhhh shhhhhh  
[soft echo]

[instrumental break]
(Traditional beats mixed with electronic sounds)

[verse 2]
Stories shared, through steps and song  
Together strong, we all belong  
A tapestry, of sound and space  
In every heart, a sacred place  
zzzzzz

[outro - Ghera Groove]  
ooooooo  
(cheerful voice) Until the dawn, we dance anew  
(cheerful voice) In harmony, the night we flew  
[festive fade]

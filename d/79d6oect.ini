lyrics = [intro - Cosmic Whisper]
shhhhh oooohhhh

[verse 1 – Starlit Embrace]
In the night, echoes call
Every word, a gentle fall
Hearts entwined, never apart
Feel the rhythm of my heart
oooooo

[Chorus – Celestial Dance]
Dance through galaxies
With every breath, we’re free
Stars align, in perfect harmony
Our love, an endless symphony
iiiiiiii

[Bridge - Cosmic Pulse]
Feel the warmth of the night
In your arms, feels so right
Let the music guide us home
In this dance, we're not alone
aaaaaahhhhh

[outro - Eternal Echo]
Whispered dreams, soft and mild
In this universe, we’re wild
Echoes fade, but love remains
In the rhythm of the rain
ooooooooh

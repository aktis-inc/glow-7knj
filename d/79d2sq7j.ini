lyrics = [intro - gentle strum]

[verse 1]
In the quiet of the evening glow
Past shadows dance in fading light
ooooo iiiii

[Pre-Chorus - Reflective]
Every step a whispered story
Carved in the dust, unseen by most
oooooo aaaah

[Chorus - Jovial Journey]
Heartbeats echo in the silence
Through open fields and endless skies
oooo ooo aaaa

[Bridge - Soul Searching]
Lost in the echoes of my own mind
Finding solace in the gentle breeze
zzzz iiiiii

[outro - fading whispers]
The road unwinds, stories unfold
Jovial reflections in the night
shhhhhhhh ooo

lyrics = [intro]
[soft tabla rhythm]

[verse 1]
In the land of dreams and whispers  
Where tales of old still dance  
Sitar strings weave the story  
A timeless, elegant romance  

[bridge]
oooooo  
iiiiiii

[Chorus]
Festival lights, hearts in flight  
Joyful echoes in the night  
Timeless whispers, ancient song  
In this world, we all belong  

[verse 2]
Drums and bells, the rhythm calls  
Through the ages, here we stand  
Modern beats with ancient souls  
Hand in hand, across the land  

[drop]
oooooo iiiiiii

13
[intro chime]
ooooooo

[verse 1 - Map Unfolds]
Sunlight on the ancient chart
Compass spins toward the heart
Finding whispers in the code
On this cosmic, golden road
aaaaaaaaa

[Pre-Chorus - High Tide]
[synth swell]
Wavecrest rising, taking flight
Everything is glowing bright

[Chorus - Starfall]
wooooooo
Celebration in the air
Leaving worry, losing care
iiiiiiiiii

[verse 2 - Hidden Bay]
Footprints fade upon the sand
Future held within your hand
Every sparkle, every gleam
Part of this electric dream
zzzzzzzzzz

[Bridge - Signal Found]
[beat accelerates]
Echoes calling, clear and true
Every path leads back to you

[Drop - Cosmic Blessing]
rrrrrrrrumble

[Outro - Horizon Fade]
[chime fade]

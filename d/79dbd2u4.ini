[verse - Eternal Journey]
The road whispers secrets, ancient and true
Wheels spin tales in the night’s hue
A melody of faith, a rhythm of stars
Guiding our path, healing our scars

[Chorus - Devotional Rise]
oooooo  
Let the light inside guide the way
In the dance of night and day
Shyam’s grace in every breath
Woooooo  
Feel the pulse, beyond death

[Bridge - Mystic Flow]
Tabla beats echo through time
Synth waves blend, divine
Chanting voices rise in harmony
A spiritual symphony, setting us free

[outro - Wheels of Destiny]
oooooo  
oooooo  
The journey’s end is just the start
In every beat, feel the heart

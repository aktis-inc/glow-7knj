lyrics = [Intro - Neon Pulse]
oooooo iiiii
whisper in the night

[Verse 1 - Urban Mirage]
Footsteps on the hollow streets  
Chasing shadows, unseen beats  
In the city’s heartbeat I find  
Echoes of dreams left behind  
ooooo aaaaaa

[Chorus - Midnight Whisper]
iiiiii iiiiii  
Chasing midnight echoes  
Through the neon glow  
wooooo wooooo

[Bridge - Echo Loop]
Silent whispers, city calls  
Between the whispers, midnight falls  
ooooo iiiii

[Verse 2 - Paradox Pulse]
In the alleys, secrets hide  
Voices lost in urban tide  
I'm a shadow, yet I see  
The dance of lights, they set me free  
ssshhhh oooo  

[Outro - Fade to Dawn]
Through the echoes, night departs  
Leaving trails of shadowed hearts  
ooooo iiiii  
whisper in the light

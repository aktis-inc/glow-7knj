lyrics = [intro - Echoes of Time]
ooooooo  
soft whispers in the air  
dreams spin like records  
iiiiiiiii  

[verse 1 – Golden Era]  
Heartbeat syncs with the past  
moments frozen in frames  
melodies linger, sweet and vast  
dancing in vibrant waves  

[Pre-Chorus – Timeless Pulse]  
ooooo  
clocks tick in reverse  
echoes of love, they never fade  

[Chorus – Cadenza Melody]  
woooooo  
timeless symphony of dreams  
harmonies weave through seams  

[Bridge - Dreamscape]  
Lost in the silver glow  
memories replay, seamless flow  
ahhhhhh oooooo  

[verse 2]  
Rhythms of yesterday, alive  
vintage echoes, softly chime  
melody's embrace, we thrive  

[drop - Nostalgic Surge]  
ooooohhh  
iiiiiiiii  

[outro - Cadenza Melody]

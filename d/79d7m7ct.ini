(synthesized voice) oooooo  
(synthesized voice) aaaaaa  
[verse - rhythmic dance]  
Spirals guide, stars align  
In the night, colors entwine  
Dance with shadows, free and bright  
Embrace the rhythm, take flight  
zzzzzzzzhhhhh  

[Chorus - Vibrant Echoes]

Dance with meeeee

Feel the beat, hearts ignite  
In the spiral, find your light  
Ancient tales, modern sound  
In this journey, we are bound  

[outro - fading spirals]  
oooooo  
iiiiiiii  
Dance through the night, till light

wooooooo  
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii  

[verse 1 – Urban Pulse]  
In the city of echoes, shadows dance  
Neon dreams in a trance, endless chance  
Tangled whispers, lost in time  
Chasing the rhythm, sublime  

[Chorus – Neon Surge]  
ooooooo  
Echoes of the night, burning bright  
In the dance of light, take flight  

[Bridge - Electric Drift]  
Lost in the waves, we find our way  
Through tangled echoes, night turns to day  
ahhhhhhhh  

[verse 2 – Shadow Play]  
In the maze of sound, we are bound  
Fading into the night, profound  

[outro - Fade to Light]  
Oooooooo  
iiiiiiiiii  
Neon whispers in the air, we're there  
Tangled echoes, we declare

lyrics = [intro - Whispering Breeze]

[gentle wave]

oooooo

[tranquil verse]

In the glow of silent flames,  
Dreams shimmer in quiet frames.  
Echoes of forgotten days,  
In the night, they softly blaze.

[ambient chorus]  
ooooo iiiii

[soft bridge]

Whispers in the silent air,  
Carried on a gentle prayer.  
Embers dance in twilight's keep,  
Guiding dreams to peaceful sleep.

[outro - Ember Fade]

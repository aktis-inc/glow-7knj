lyrics = [intro - Whispered Beginning]

[verse 1]  
In shadows, the threads are spun  
Beneath the sun's quiet hum  
Silent calls from distant shores  
iiiiiiiiii

[Pre-Chorus - Melodic Rise]  
Gentle hands weave the unseen  
In the spaces in between  
oooooo  

[Chorus - Harmonious Flow]  
Our whispers echo through the trees  
In the dance of the breeze  
We find our way, unseen paths unfold  
wooooo

[Bridge - Ethereal Weave]  
Tales of heart, stories untold  
In the weave, our dreams unfold  
ahhhh

[outro - Fading Threads]  
Threads of love, forever spun  
In the light of the setting sun  
oooooo iiiiii

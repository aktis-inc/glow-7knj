[soft whispers]  
ahhhh  
oooooo

[verse - Echoes]
Time flows like rivers unseen  
In shadows of forgotten dreams  
Whispers of eternity linger  
In the silence of the stars

[glowing drift]

[bridge - Dreamscape]  
aahhhh  
The echoes speak in colors  
Neon hues and gentle sighs  
In the timeless dance of light

[outro - Fade Away]

[verse 1 - Time's Call]  
oooooo  
In the folds of time, I wander  
Traditions weave with neon dreams  

[Pre-Chorus – Echoes of Tomorrow]  
aaaaaaa  
Through the streets of light and shadow  
iiiiii  
Past and present in harmony  

[Chorus – Dance of Ages]  
ooooo  
Dance with me through the ages  
Time's rhythm never ceases  

[Bridge - Temporal Flow]  
shhhhh  
Step by step, we ride the currents  
ooooo  
Melodies of past and future meet  

[outro - Fade into Time]

lyrics = [intro - gentle dawn]

[verse 1]
On this path of stories untold  
Where whispers of the past unfold

[chorus - echoes of the dust]  
iiiiiiii  
ooooooo  
Voices rise, ancient songs  
In the heart where they belong

[bridge - soulful journey]  
Through the mist, dreams we chase  
In the dance of time and space

[verse 2]
Every step, a tale begins  
In the rhythm of the winds

[outro - fading light]  
oooooo  
iiiiiii  
Footprints fade, but songs remain  
In the echoes of the dust, our refrain

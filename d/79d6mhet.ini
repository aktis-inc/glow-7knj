lyrics = [intro thunder]

[verse]
Vibrant skies, echoes call
Tradition dances, modern falls
Rhythms weave, stories told
In the storm, hearts unfold  
oooooo

[Pre-Chorus - Rising Pulse]
Beneath the thunder, we find our way
Through shadows, in light we sway

[Chorus - Electric Dance]
iiiiiiiiii  
Dance in lightning's embrace
Feel the heartbeat, trace by trace

[Bridge - Ethereal Echo]
Old and new, in harmony's grace
Bound by time, space

[outro - Thunder's Lullaby]
ssshhh  
In the storm's arms, we dream

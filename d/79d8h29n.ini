[verse]

Floating echoes, serene whispers,  
In silence, the heart finds peace.  
Softly swaying, in timeless grace,  
A melody of the soul's release.

[soft chorus]
oooooo  
eeeeee

[verse]

Golden dreams, beneath the sky,  
Eternal light, guiding the way.  
In the stillness, spirits fly,  
To realms where night meets day.

[outro - fading light]

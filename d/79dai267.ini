lyrics = [intro - echo]

[verse]
In the shadows, whispers call  
Echoes of the unknown, they fall  
[glitch - rise]  
Smooth as silk, paths unfold  
Stories untold in the night, bold  

[drop - bass surge]

[chorus]
In the neon glow, we ride  
Through the echoes, side by side  
wooooo ooooo  

[bridge]
Silent streets, secrets weave  
In the rhythm, we believe  
ahhhh ahhhh  

[outro - fade]
Lost in echoes, we remain  
In the night, we find our name

lyrics = [Intro - Temple Chime]

[Verse - Rhythmic Echo]
In the heart of the sacred grove,
Whispers of old tales flow,
Through the corridors of time,
Where the spirit learns to climb.

[Chorus - Harmonic Rise]
oooooo
Voices of the ancients,
Resonating with grace,
iiiiiiiiii
Beneath the star-lit expanse.

[Bridge - Devotional Flow]
Chanting through the night,
Guided by the inner light,
Their songs as a guiding flame,
Illuminating the path of the same.

[Outro - Serenity Drift]
oooooo
Into the mystical embrace,
The soul finds its place,
In the echoes of devotion. aaaa

lyrics = [intro - gentle rustle]

[verse 1]
In the amber glow, the leaves dance low
A whispering tale unfolds
We walk where dreams and memories flow
In autumn's gentle hold

[Pre-Chorus]
ooooo aaaa
In the breeze, we find our way
Through shadows and light, we sway

[Chorus]
Whispers of the autumn breeze
Carry dreams and melodies
iiiiii aaaaa
In this moment, we are free

[Bridge]
Golden hues and faded skies
Reflections in your eyes
ooooo iiiii
Time stands still, as nature sighs

[outro - fading echo]
The leaves fall, as we say goodbye
In the autumn breeze, we fly

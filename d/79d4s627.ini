lyrics = [intro - serene awakening]

[verse 1]
Whispers of dawn, in the silent breeze
Echoes of tales, from ancient trees
ooooohhhh

[Pre-Chorus - Rising Harmony]
iiiiiiii

[Chorus - Lumin's Embrace]
In the light, shadows dance
Through the heart, time expands
ahhhhh

[Bridge - Cultural Weave]
Traditions flow, in rivers wide
Modern dreams, in harmony glide
oooooo

[verse 2]
Threads of gold, in the fabric of night
Songs untold, in the moon's gentle light

[outro - gentle fade]
shhhhhhh

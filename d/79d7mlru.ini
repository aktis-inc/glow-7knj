lyrics = [intro - gentle whispers]

[verse 1 - Soft Reflections]
In the quiet of the night
Dreams unfold, a gentle light
Soft whispers in the breeze
Carrying secrets through the trees

[chorus - Veil of Dreams]
ooooo aaaaaa
Don't wake me from this dream
Where love flows like a stream
iiiiii

[verse 2 - Wistful Echoes]
In the stillness, hearts align
Time suspended, souls entwine
Gentle chords of life's refrain
Echo softly, like a gentle rain

[bridge - Ethereal Flow]
ooohhhh
Dreams weave through the night
Guiding us with their light
ooooo

[outro - Whispered Lullaby]
In dreams, we find our way
Through the night into day
aaaaaa oooooo

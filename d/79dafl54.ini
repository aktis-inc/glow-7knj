lyrics = [intro - city whispers]
  
[verse 1 - Urban Echo]
Under neon skies we move  
Every shadow tells a tale  
Dance through the lies we prove  
In the night, secrets prevail  
oooooo

[Chorus - Rhythmic Pulse]
Echoes of deception  
In the city's heartbeat  
Feel the connection  
Where truth and dreams meet  
woooooo eeeeee

[Bridge - Silhouette Dance]
Streetlights flicker like broken truths  
In the rhythm of our youth  
Step by step, we chase the night  
In the dance, we find the light  
shhhh

[outro - fading whispers]
The city whispers, secrets in the rain  
We dance through echoes, feeling no pain  
iiiiii

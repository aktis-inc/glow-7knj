mmmmmmm
oooooooo

[verse 1 - City Lights]
In the shadows of the night,
A saxophone's sweet serenade,
Echoes dance in the twilight,
As dreams and memories fade
mmmmmm

[chorus - Neon Pulse]
ooooo
There's something in the air,
A melody beyond compare,
iiiii
Whispering secrets you can find,
In echoes of the mind

[saxophone solo]

[verse 2 - Urban Dreams]
Underneath the neon glow,
Stories in the breeze flow,
Guitar strings hum low,
In the heart of the city, slow

[bridge - Midnight Reflections]
haaaaa
In the city's silent hum,
Saxophone and dreams become one
ooooo

[outro - Echoes Fade]
iiiiii
Let the night take you away,
In echoes of the mind, we sway
ooooo

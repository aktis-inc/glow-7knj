lyrics = [intro - Moonlit Whisper]
oooooo aaaaaa

[verse 1 - Dream's Embrace]
In the hush of the night, we find our way  
Guided by stars, where shadows sway  
iiiiiii

[chorus - Starlit Serenade]
oooooo  
Together in dreams, we softly sing  
Hearts entwined by the night's gentle wing 

[bridge - Whispering Winds]
Through the night, our secrets flow  
In the moon's light, our love will grow  
sssssshhhhh

[outro - Echoes of Nightfall]
The stars fade, but love remains  
A timeless dance, in moonlit chains  
ooooo iiiii

lyrics = [intro - Whispering Winds]

[verse 1 - Forest Path]  
Softly the night speaks  
Through leaves that dance in silence  
Gentle heartbeats echo

[chorus - Twilight Glow]  
oooooo  
Dreams woven in starlight  
iiiiiiiiii

[bridge - Enchanted Whispers]  
Kaleidoscope dreams  
Unfold like petals in dawn  
Serene and endless

[outro - Fading Echoes]  
[soft hum]  
A journey through twilight

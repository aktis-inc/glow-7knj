lyrics = [intro]
(soft hum) mmmmm
(crackle) iiiiiii
(whisper) echoes in the city

[verse 1 - Old Streets]
Walking through the lanes of dreams
Where every shadow tells a tale
Silent whispers in the seams
Of time, as memories sail

[Chorus - Echo Waves]
ooooooo
iiiiii
Through the noise, hear the calm
In the heart of the storm's palm

[Bridge - Fading Lights]
City lights, like stars below
Fading fast, but still they glow
shshshsh

[outro - Into the Night]
(soft hum) mmmmm
(crackle) iiiiiii
(whisper) echoes in the city

lyrics = [intro - gentle whisper]

[verse 1 - City Lights]
In the glow of fading lights, time unwinds
Soft echoes of yesterday, gently bind
oooooo iiiii

[Chorus - Whispered Release]
In the silence, we find our way
Letting go, the night turns to day
ahhhhhhh

[verse 2 - Hidden Paths]
Under stars, secrets unfold
Stories of old, whispered and told
zzzzzzhhh

[Bridge - Echoes of Tomorrow]
Future calls, in gentle tones
Dreams of past, no longer alone
oooooo iiiii

[outro - Ulmira's Embrace]
Let the city cradle the night
In its arms, find our light
shhhhhhh]

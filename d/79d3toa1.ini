lyrics = [intro - mystical whispers]

[verse 1]
In the shadows of time, secrets unfold  
Ancient whispers call, stories untold  

[chorus - ethereal echo]  
oooo iiiii aaaa

[bridge - celestial dance]  
Stars align, fate's gentle touch  
In Sarin's dream, we find our crutch  

[outro - fading light]  
Softly we drift, into the night  
Sarin's reverie, a guiding light

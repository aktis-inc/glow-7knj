[verse 1 - Gentle Bloom]
The garden whispers secrets untold  
Petals unfold in the morning light  
Moments etched in time, timeless and warm

[chorus - Embrace]
oooooo  
iiiiiiii
In your arms, I find my place  
Your love, a guiding grace  
Blooming with every embrace

[bridge - Echoes of Love]
In the silence, your voice lingers  
Through the echoes, I remember  
shhhh oooo

[verse 2 - Eternal Spring]
Every note, a memory  
Every chord, a story untold  
Growing, blooming, intertwined

[outro - Blooming Harmony]
oooo  
iiiiiiii  
Your love, my sanctuary  
Forever in this harmonious bloom

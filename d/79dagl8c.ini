lyrics = [intro]
(soft tabla rhythm)  
Flute echoes in the dawn  
Dancers rise with the sun

[verse 1]  
Colors burst into song  
Feet tap, hearts belong  
Sitar strings vibrate the air  
Harmony in every layer  
oooooo iiiii

[chorus]  
Echoes of Ulara  
Dance through the night  
Lively steps, hearts bright  
In the festival light  
oooooo eeeeee

[bridge]  
Tradition meets today  
Melodies sway, never betray  
In the pulse of the drum  
All voices become one

[verse 2]  
Rhythmic joy, unstoppable  
Life's dance, unstoppable  
Through the echo, we unite  
Celebrate under starlight  
aaaaaa iiiiii

[outro]  
(soft flute and tabla fade)  
In the echoes, we find our way  
Ulara leads, come what may

lyrics = [intro - Ethereal Call]

[verse 1 - Whispering Vines]
In the city of dreams, echoes call
Sitar's voice dances through the hall

[Pre-Chorus - Melodic Flow]
ooooo
iiiiiiii

[Chorus - Harmonious Fusion]
Hearts entwined, rhythm's embrace
Tradition and future in a timeless space

[Bridge - Twilight's Melody]
Flute sings softly, under moonlit skies
Tabla's heartbeat, in rhythms it flies
aaaaaa

[verse 2 - Resonant Souls]
Voices entwine, ancient and new
Melody of ages, through our souls it blew

[outro - Xylar Echoes]
oooooo
iiiiiiii
The symphony fades, yet lingers on
Eternal echoes, never truly gone

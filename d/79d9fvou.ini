[verse]

Soft whispers in the night,  
Chasing dreams, yet out of sight,  
Through the glass, the city glows,  
In the rhythm, the heart knows.

[chorus - Horizon's Call]

oooo iiiii  
Chasing the horizon,  
Lost in its glow,  
iiiiii ooooo 

[bridge - Luminous Drift]

Waves of light,  
In endless flight,  
oooooo iiiiiii

[outro - Fading Light]

As dawn breaks, we find,  
The journey's end, undefined.  
oooo iiiii

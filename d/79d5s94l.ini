lyrics = [intro - vibrant waves]

[verse]  
In the market by the sea, colors blend with melody  
Voices rise in harmony, stories of the old and free

[chorus]  
ooooo  
Dance with the tide, where the heartbeats collide  
iiiiii  
Joy in the air, feel the world everywhere

[bridge - festive echoes]  
laughter and cheers, through the years  
oooooo  
echoes of the sea, setting us free

[verse]  
In the dance, we find our place, every step a warm embrace  
Tradition and the new entwine, in the rhythm, we align

[outro - vibrant waves]

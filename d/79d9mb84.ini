[verse]
Sol en los ojos, sombras que danzan
Caminos de soledad, entre risas y cantos

[chorus - vibrant rhythm]
ooooo  
iiiiiiii   
Cielo abierto, corazón despierto  
Aaaaaaaa

[bridge - brass flourish]
Las luces juegan en la piel, destellos de miel  
Caminos cruzados, sueños sembrados

[verse]
Entre murales y sonrisas, historias tejidas  
Ooooooo  
iiiiiiiiii

[outro - tropical fade]
Caminos de soledad, siempre en libertad  
Aaaahhhh  
ooooo

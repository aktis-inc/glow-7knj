ooooo  
(let's go play)  
[verse - Winter's Call]  
Through the frosty glass, we gaze  
A world of snowflakes and grace  
Come, let's build dreams in the snow  
Where wishes and laughter flow  
[Chorus - Snowman Waltz]  
ooooo  
Together, hand in hand  
In this wonderland  
[bridge - Dreamer's Echo]  
Listen, the snow sings our name  
In whispers of playful fame  
[outro - Frosty Farewell]  
iiiiiiii  
(snowflakes fall)  
Till we meet again…

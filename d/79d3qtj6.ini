[verse]
In shadows, memories breathe
Silent echoes, waves beneath
oooooo

[Pre-Chorus]
Whispers of the tide
In the night's embrace
iiiii

[Chorus]
Xylo's heart, a galaxy
Lost in the sea's vast melody

[Bridge]
Stars align on a broken path
Hope's gentle hand, a distant raft
oooooo

[outro - fading echoes]

lyrics = [intro - Awakening Echoes]
gentle breeze ooooo  
waves of sound aaaa

[verse - Life's Reflection]  
In the whispers of the dawn  
Stories unfold in silence  
Every heartbeat a new tale  
Kavira sings with the earth

[chorus - Echoed Dreams]  
iiiiiiii ooooooo  
Life's echo, a gentle call  
Through the valleys and the sky

[bridge - Soul's Journey]  
Winding paths, unseen trails  
Kavira's heart beats with the land  
Resonating in harmony

[outro - Twilight Whisper]  
soft hums iiiiii  
fade into the evening light

lyrics = [intro - Soft Waves]
oooooo  
[verse 1 - Mystic Dance]  
In the rhythm of the night, we sway
Tradition whispers, guiding our way  
oooooo  
[Pre-Chorus - Cultural Pulse]  
Echoes of the past, beating in the heart  
Our steps aligned, never to part  
[Chorus - Rhythmic Waves]  
oooo  
We dance in the fusion, lost in the waves  
iiiiii  
Our spirits free, in the light they bathe  
[Bridge - Interlude of Harmony]  
Tradition and modernity, hand in hand  
Creating new worlds, like grains of sand  
[outro - Fading Light]  
oooo  
In the end, we find our place  
In the dance, in the embrace

lyrics = [intro]
whispering echoes  
oooooo

[verse]
Time flows in silent streams  
Through the valleys of dreams  
Every moment carries a tale  
Of love, of loss, of sails

[chorus]
iiiiiii  
Embrace the timeless sky  
Where the echoes never die  
oooooo  
iiiiiii

[bridge]
Floating through the mist of time  
Hearts entwined in cosmic rhyme  
oooooo  
zzzzzz

[outro]
In the end, we find our place  
In the vastness of time's embrace  
shhhhhhh

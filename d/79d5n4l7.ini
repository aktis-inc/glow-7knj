[verse]
In the heart's quiet chamber
Where whispers weave the air
A gaze speaks volumes
In the dance of longing stares

[Pre-Chorus - Crescendo]
Strings and sighs entwined
Desires echo in the night

[Chorus - Passion's Embrace]
iiiii oooooo
Hearts beat in time
A dance divine

[Bridge - Whispered Secrets]
In shadows, truths unfold
A story silently told

[outro - Fading Echo]
oooo iiiii
A waltz of dreams
In whispered beams

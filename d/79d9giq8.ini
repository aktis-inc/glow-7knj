lyrics = [Intro - Beat Surge]
ooooo ooooo  
hey hey hey

[Verse 1 - Vibrant Pulse]
In the night, we shine bright  
Rhythm takes us to new heights  
Every step, a story told  
In echoes of the young and bold  
oooooo aaaaa

[Chorus - Dance Echoes]
We move, we groove, we fly  
Under neon, we won't be shy  
Laughter and beats, a perfect blend  
In this dance, there is no end  
wooohoo oooo

[Bridge - Electric Vibe]
Feel the bass, let it guide  
In this moment, nothing to hide  
A celebration of sound and light  
Dance with me through the night  
iiiiii ooooh

[Outro - Youthful Glow]
ooooo  
Dance on, dance on  
Into the dawn  
oooooo

[verse 1 â€“ City Serenade]
Under the skyline's watchful gaze
Traditions weave through modern haze

Dancing in echoes of ages past
Vibrant rhythms, forever to last

In the pulse of the city, we find our way
Tradition and future in harmonious play
shhhhhh ahhhh

[verse 2 â€“ Echoing Streets]
Voices rise, a tapestry of sound
In every beat, our stories are found

[outro - Melodic Fade]
wooooooo iiiiiiiiiii

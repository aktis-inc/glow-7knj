[verse 1 – Ancient Paths]  
Rhythms of the past, echo through time  
A dance of shadows, in vibrant light  
ooooooo

Tradition whispers, in digital streams  
Harmony of worlds, where dreams collide  
oooooo  
iiiiiiiii

[Chorus – Lyrin Echoes]

[Bridge – Ethereal Flow] 
Where the old meets new, a journey unfolds  
In the heart of sound, echoes of Lyrin told  
Ahhhh ooooo

Pulses of the earth, vibrate with life  
Melodies entwined, in cosmic flight

[glitch build-up]

oooooo iiiiii  
Lyrin Echoes, forever resonate]

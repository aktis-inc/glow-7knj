oooooo iiiiiii

[verse]
A call from the shadows
Whispers in neon skies
Dancing with echoes
In the city's vibrant eyes
oooo

[chorus]
Hunt the night, chase the stars
Feel the rhythm, break the bars

oooooo

Through the alleys, through the light
A digital chase, a hunter's flight
Ahhhhhhh

[outro]
oooooo iiiiiii
The call of the hunter, ever bright

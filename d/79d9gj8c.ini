lyrics = [intro]
ooooooo  
[verse 1]  
In the city's gentle hum, secrets softly purr  
Between the buildings, shadows dance and blur  
[Chorus]  
Whiskers touch the silent streets, dreams unfold  
In hidden corners, stories quietly told  
ooooo  
[Bridge]  
Paws on pavement, whispers in the air  
Secret paths and hidden lairs  
[Outro]  
ooooooo  
Hidden whiskers in the night

[verse 1 - Colorful Steps]
In the glow of ancient lanterns  
Voices rise like sunlit streams  
Pathways lit by heart's intentions  
Dreams unfold like silken beams  
woooo

[chorus - Joyful Harmony]  
iiiiii  
Together we sing, the world in tune  
Bound by the light of the silver moon

[bridge - Echoing Drums]  
aaaaaa  
Hands that reach in unity  
Hearts that beat in harmony

[verse 2 - Spirited Dance]
Dance the rhythm of the ages  
Feel the pulse of earth and sky  
Every note a story's pages  
In the song, together we fly  
oooooo

[outro - Celebration Glow]  
Echoes of joy, through the night  
Under starlit, vibrant light  
aaaa ooooo

lyrics = [Intro – Echoes]
whispering oooooo

[Verse 1 – Neon Shadows]  
Through the veil, we drift in silence  
Echos stir, in the neon glow  
Whispers call, in the shadows  
Lost in dreams, where the secrets flow  
iiiii ooooo

[Chorus – Oblivion's Call]  
Beyond the light, we find our way  
In the void, where the echoes play  
oooooo aaaaa  
Whispers of oblivion, guide our stay

[Bridge – Ethereal Waves]  
Floating through the cosmic sea  
Where time and space cease to be  
Ahhhhhh  
iiiiiiii

[Verse 2 – Glowing Dreams]  
In the dance of stars and shadows  
We surrender to the flow  
In the heart of endless echoes  
We find the place where dreams grow  
zzzzz ooooo

[Outro – Fade into Light]  
Whispering winds, taking flight  
In the glow of endless night  
ooohhhh  
fade out...

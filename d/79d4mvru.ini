[soft verse]
(Whispered echoes) Mira dances in the breeze
With every step, the world shifts
iiiiiiiiii  
oooooo

[verse 1 – Ethereal Dance]
The dawn whispers secrets in her ear
Lotus blooms beneath her feet
Dreams weave through the air
In the silence, she finds peace
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[Chorus – Celestial Whirl]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii

[mystical bridge] 
She spins in the cosmic light
Every turn, a new universe
Ahhhhhh shshshsh  
[echoed breath]

[verse 2]
The stars align in her gaze
Time stands still, a fleeting moment
In her heart, a timeless song

[outro - Mira's Whirl]
ssshhhh oooo  
(Whispered echoes) Beyond the horizon, she dances on

lyrics = [intro - serene whispers]

[verse - gentle rise]
Soft echoes in the night
A heart's quiet embrace
Waves of light, soft and bright
In silence we find grace
oooooo

[chorus - soothing flow]
iiiiiiiii
Feel the breath of stars
Whispering through the dark
A melody that heals
In cosmic lullabies

[bridge - ethereal drift]
Peaceful mind, floating free
In the vast infinity
oooooo iiiiii

[outro - fading echoes]
Silent heartbeats, gentle glow
In this space, we let go
ahhhhhhh

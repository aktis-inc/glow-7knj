lyrics = [intro - Echoing Beats]
Floating through the echoes,   
In the dance of time,  
Hear the whispers of the heart,   
In a world of rhyme.  

[verse - Timeless Steps]  
Dance with me in shadows,  
Where stories intertwine,  
Lost in vibrant colors,  
Where dreams dare to align.  

[chorus - Eternal Rhythm]  
ooooo aaaah  
Timeless echoes call,  
In a world so bright,  
Where love never falls,  
Dancing through the night.  

[bridge - Whispered Moments]  
iiiiiiiii  
In the silence of the stars,  
Our hearts find their way,  
Tales written in the dark,  
Guided by the sway.  

[outro - Fading Lights]  
oooo ahhhh  
As the music fades,  
In the lingering glow,  
Echoes of our serenade,  
In timeless flow.

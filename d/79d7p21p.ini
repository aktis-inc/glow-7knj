zzzzhhh  
ooooooo

[verse - Inferno Stare]  
Flames rise in shadows cast  
In the glow, the future's past  
Echoes in electric haze  
Through the night, a burning gaze  
ssssssss

[drop - Pulse of Fire]  
iiiiiiii  
oooooo  
Feel the heat, it never tires  
In the core, the inferno fires

[bridge - Ember Dance]  
zzzzzz  
Steps in sync with the flame  
Names erased in the game  
ahhhhhhh

[chorus - Blaze]  
wooooooo  
Feel it in your veins  
The pulse remains  
Burn it down, let it reign  
oooooooooo

[outro - Smoldering Silence]  
[whispered echoes]  
iiiiiiiiii  
The light fades, embers glow  
In the ashes, stories grow  
zzzzzhhhhhh

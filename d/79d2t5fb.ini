[verse 1]
Under the glow, secrets unfold  
Shadows dance, stories untold  
oooooo iiiii  

[chorus - Midnight Call]  
In the night, whispers fly  
Through the wires, they never lie  
ahhhhh eeeeee  

[bridge - Electric Pulse]  
Echoes fade, but the heart stays  
In this maze, lost in a daze  
wooo shhhhhh  

[outro - Fading Glow]  
Listen close, to the sound  
Jovial hotline, all around  
ooooo iiiiii]

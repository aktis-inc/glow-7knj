[verse - Past Whispers]
ooooo
In the echoes of forgotten tales
Through time, their stories sail
Silent dreams in the night
A tapestry of sound, woven light

[chorus - Harmonious Dance]
ohhhh
iiiiii
Where the past and future meet
In the rhythm of heartbeats
A melody so sweet
Eternal echoes, bittersweet

[bridge - Cultural Blend]
aaaaa
Tradition's voice, a guiding star
In the music, near and far
Symbols dancing in the air
A connection, rare and fair

[outro - Fade to Silence]
oooo
Whispers of history
Lingering melody
In the echoes, we find
A bridge through time, entwined

lyrics = [intro - Urban Awakening]
rhythmic city pulse  
shadows dance in neon glow

[verse 1 – Cosmic Flow]  
voices rise, streets alive  
echoes of the urban tide  
quasar light, guiding night  
oooo oooo

[Chorus – Galactic Drive]  
iiiiii  
pulsing, thriving, never still  
beneath the stars, city thrill

[Bridge - Echoes of Light]  
neon dreams, pathways bright  
whispers of the cosmic flight  
ahhhhhh

[verse 2]  
beats collide, rhythms ride  
energy flows, can't hide  
quasar pulse, city pride

[outro - Fading Echo]  
shhhh iiiii

ROAR

[verse 1 - Defiance]
In the storm, I stand my ground  
Chains won't bind my soul  
I won't be perfect, nor will I bow  
To standards I don't own

[Pre-Chorus - Rising Tension]
oooooo  
iiiiiiiiii  
I'll claim my truth, my own way  
In shadows, I find my light

[Chorus - Breaking Free]
Back off, let me breathe  
I'm more than what you see  
My path is mine to weave  
Back off, back off  
Freedom calls to me

[Bridge - Inner Strength]
Healing's an unseen art  
Coping's a silent fight  
Intentions buried deep  
I rise in my own right

[verse 2 - Resilience]  
Bias can't define my choice  
My heart beats true and loud  
I'm not a shadow of your fears  
I'll stand against the crowd

[glitch build-up]
shhhhh  
ooooooo

[outro - Empowered Echo]
Iiiiiiiii  
Back off, let me breathe  
Back off, back off  
Freedom calls to me

lyrics = [intro - dark awakening]

[verse - shadows]
Whispers of the past, call through the void
Ruins stand tall, memories deployed

[build-up - tension rise]
(heartbeat thumps)
ooooo iiiii

[chorus - echoing resolve]
In echoes of the last stand, we remain
Through shattered dreams, we find our way

[instrumental - synth surge]
[soft chorus - ethereal rise]
ooooo iiiii
(ghostly harmonies)

[bridge - desolate echoes]
Lost in time, we walk alone
Footsteps on forgotten stone

[outro - fading whispers]
As the red sky fades, we drift away
Into the night, where shadows play

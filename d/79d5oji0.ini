Guitars whisper tales of yesterdays

[verse - Memory Drift]
In shadows of the past, we wander
Footsteps echo, hearts ponder

[Bridge - Crescendo]

iiiiii
Lost in dreams, time slips away

[Chorus - Resonate]
Carry me through the echoes
Where the heart still knows
iiiiii aaaaaa

[guitar solo - soaring]
ooooooo

[outro - Fading Light]
As the sun sets, silence remains
iiiiii oooooo

[verse - haunted echoes]
distant shadows
call through the night
echoes of red
in the dim light

[glitch build-up]  
ooooo iiiiii

[chorus - crimson dance]  
whispering winds
through the veil
ooooo

[bridge - eerie calm]  
murmurs in the dark
heartbeat slows
iiiii oooooo

[outro - fading mystery]
fading… into… red…
ooooo iiiiii

(soft piano and guitar melodies)  
ooooo iiiii

[verse 1 - Gentle Rise]  
Within the stillness, whispers of grace  
Hearts lift softly, finding their place  
mmmmmmm

[Pre-Chorus - Embrace]  
[soft harmonies]
ooooo  
A light that guides, a gentle trace  
In every breath, a warm embrace  

[Chorus - Ascend]  
woooooo  
iiiiiii  
Hearts unfold in the light of day  
Carried by the gentle sway

[Bridge - Tranquil Flow]  
Through the silence, peace like a stream  
Life's gentle dance, a waking dream  
Ahhhhhhh

[outro - Serenity Drift]  
(soft instrumental fade)  
ooooo iiiiiiii

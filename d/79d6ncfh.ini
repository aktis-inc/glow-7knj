[verse 1 - Star Whisper]
Underneath the twilight sky  
Dreams fade, whispers fly  
Across the sands of time  
Each echo a gentle rhyme  
oooooo iiiiii

[Pre-Chorus - Desert Glow]  
Softly, stars begin to glow  
Silent tales they softly show  
iiiiii oooooo

[Chorus - Fading Echoes]  
Let the echoes sing  
Of what the night will bring  
Lost in the gentle sway  
Of a dream that fades away  
ahhhhhhh

[Bridge - Starlit Path]  
Walking on a path of light  
Guided by the silent night  
Every step a tender call  
In the glow of stars, we fall  
oooo iiiiiii

[outro - Twilight Fade]  
Gentle fade, soft retreat  
In the night, dreams complete  
ahhhhh iiiiii  
[fade out]

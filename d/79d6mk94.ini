lyrics = [intro beat]
(Street noise) Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Pulsing bass) Ooooo
[verse 1 - Urban Pulse]
In the city where the lights never fade
Echoes of chaos in every parade
Balancing life, like Zen on a blade
Voices in the night, truth we invade
Ahhhhhhh

[Chorus - Gravity Shift]
Zero gravity, we rise, no disguise
In the neon haze, we find our prize
iiiiiiii  

[Bridge - Echoes of Zen]
Riding on thoughts, wheels turn and spin
In the heart of the storm, we begin
Whispers of wisdom, within, within
Ahhhh shhhhh

[verse 2 - Streets of Gold]
Concrete jungle, stories untold
Lines like graffiti, bold and cold
Spinning the tale of the brave and bold
In the rhythm of life, we break the mold
Yooooo

[outro - Balance and Flow]
(Soft echoes) ooooo  
Zen and the art of rhyme, we go

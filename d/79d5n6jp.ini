[verse 1 – Echoes of Time]
Yonder hills whisper  
Tales of hearts untold

Chimes in the breeze  
Carry dreams afar  
ahhhhhhh

Hearts align  
In echoes of time  
oooo  
iiiiiiii

[Bridge – Turtles' Tower]
Towering dreams  
In the silence of stars

[verse 2 – Whispered Tales]
Through the night  
Stories unfold

eeeeehhh

[Outro – Fade into Light]
Endless echoes  
In the glow of dawn  
ooooo  
iiiiii]

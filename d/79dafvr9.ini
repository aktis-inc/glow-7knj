lyrics = [intro]
Desert sands whisper dreams
iiiiiii ooooooo

[verse 1]
In the sunlit haze, stories unfold
Drums beat like hearts, bold and untold
Dancing shadows, laughter in the air
We find our rhythm, in the desert's care
ooooohhhh

[chorus]
Echoes in the sand, where we stand
iiiiiii aaaaa
Songs of the land, hand in hand
oooooo iiiiii

[bridge]
Colors swirl, under the sky's vast dome
In this place, our spirits roam
oooo ooooo

[outro]
Desert echoes fade, but never die
iiiiiiii aaaaaa
In our hearts, they forever lie

Shulam bushundim shirah

Shankham sanda dhatim kare strinayanam,

Saravanga bhushaptan

Jai maa kali, jai maa kali

Jan chahe lenee pade,

Balee ham chadhayenge

Jai kali, jai kali,

Nash dusht kaa karne wali

Jai kali, jai kali,

Nash dusht kaa karne wali

Jai maa kali, jan chahe leni pade,

Jan chahe denee pade

Balee ham chadhayenge

Jai kali, jai kali,

Nash dusht kaa karne wali

Jai kali, jai kali,

Nash dusht kaa karne wali

Jai maa kali

Krodhit jab ho kape duneeya,

Khush ho toh pal me din phere

Palanharee pralayana hari,

Sab kuchh ma hathon me tere

Jai kali, jai kali,

Padadashakam seve maha kalikam

Yamastaout svapite harou kamalajo

Hantum madhum kaitabham

Sare jag me hai kaun aisa,

Aage tere sar jo uthaye

Kat jate hai woh sar ek din,

Abhiman jin me aa jaye

Jai maa kali jai maa kali

Pranata nam prasidyakam

Devi vaishwata harinim

Trailokyavasinim lokanam varada bhava

Jai maa kali, jai maa kali.

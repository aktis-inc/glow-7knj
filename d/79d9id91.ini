lyrics = [intro - Neon Pulse]

[chorus]
iiiiiiii   
Follow the light, paths unseen  
In the city of dreams

[verse 1]
Streets alive with hidden tales  
Every step, a secret trail  

[Pre-Chorus]
oooooooo   
Feel the rhythm, feel the beat  
Lost in echoes, neon heat  

[Chorus - Radiant Glow]  
woooooo  
iiiiiiii

[Bridge - Electric Flow]  
Through the alleys, through the mist  
Whispers in the distance kissed  

[verse 2]
Skyline's dance, a symphony  
In this maze, we find the key  

[outro - Luminescent Drift]
iiiiiiii  
City lights fade, dreams remain  
In the night, we start again

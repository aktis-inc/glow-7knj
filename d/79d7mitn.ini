[Verse - Rising Heat]
Flames lick the edges, city of light  
In the shadows, we ignite  
iii oooooo

[Chorus - Inferno Pulse]
Burn through the night, rise up high  
With the fire inside, we fly  
oooooo iiiii

[Bridge - Ember's Call]
Heat of the moment, heart beats fast  
In the ashes, nothing lasts  
ahhhh

[Verse 2 - Smoldering Echo]
Voices echo in the blaze's glow  
In the depths, we start to grow  
zzzzz

From the flames, we emerge anew  
In the fire, find the true  
oooo iiiii

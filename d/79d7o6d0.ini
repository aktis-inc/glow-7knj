lyrics = [intro - city whispers]

[verse]  
Amidst the neon glow, secrets unfold  
In the rhythm of the street, stories untold  
Whispers in the alley, echoes of the night  
Threads of intrigue weave out of sight  

[Pre-Chorus - Rising Beat]  
oooooo  
In the pulse of the city, dreams take flight  
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

[Chorus - Electric Pulse]  
wooooooo  
Dance through shadows, into the light  
Threads of intrigue, hold on tight  
ooooooo

[Bridge - Synth Surge]  
Feel the beat, heart's desire  
In the city's embrace, ignite the fire  
ahhhhhhhhhh  
[echoed synth]

[verse 2]  
Underneath the stars, mysteries play  
In the city's rhythm, we'll find our way  
Whispers turn to echoes in the night  
Threads of intrigue, hold on tight

[outro - Fade to Silence]

(soft guitar)
oooooo

[verse 1 - Whispering Palms]
In the shadow of the night
Spirits rise to take flight
Dancing in the warm delight
Hearts entwined, burning bright

[Chorus - Echoes of the Heart]
Vibrant echoes call us near
Feel the rhythm, lose your fear
iiiiiiii
oooooo

[Bridge - Midnight Revelry]
Under stars, we find our way
In this dance, we will sway
Love’s embrace, come what may
ooooo iiiiii

[Verse 2 - Serenade of Dreams]
Moonlit paths, the night unfolds
Stories told, dreams retold
In our hearts, the music holds

[Outro - Eternal Dance]
Echoes linger, love’s refrain
In this dance, we’ll remain
ooooooo

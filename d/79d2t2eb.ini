lyrics = [intro]
The breeze carries ancient tales  
Harmonies echo through the valley  
ooooo iiiii

[verse 1 – Whispered Joy]  
In the fields where dreams are sown  
Every note is a gentle touch  
Soft whispers, a soulful embrace  
Beneath the open sky, we dance  
aaaaa

[chorus – Soul's Serenade]  
ooooo  
In the wind, our spirits soar  
Harmony in every breath taken

[bridge – Eternal Echo]  
Zephyr's song, a timeless tune  
Carrying love across the lands  
wooooo  
[soft echo]

[verse 2]  
Through the golden fields we roam  
With every step, a heartbeat's song  
Gentle waves of sound caress

[outro – Zephyr's Embrace]  
iiiiii  
Beneath the stars, the story ends  
Yet echoes linger in the night  
[fade out]

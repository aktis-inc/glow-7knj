lyrics = [intro - Twilight Echoes]
ooooo

[verse - Whispered Lands]
Ancient winds, tell their tale
Rhythms weave, a sacred veil
iiiii

[Chorus - Seraph's Dance]
oooooo
Echoes in the night, guiding light
Seraph wings, take flight
ahhhhh

[Bridge - Ethereal Shadows]
Chants rise, through the mist
Dreams unfold, in twilight's fist
shhhhh

[verse - Rhythmic Shadows]
Melodies of old, stories untold
Through shadowed lands, we behold
zzzz

[outro - Seraph's Echo]
oooooo
whispering winds, fade away
in echoes, we stay

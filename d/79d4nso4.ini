lyrics = [intro - Radiant Dawn]
(whisper) Path ahead, glowing light  
(whisper) Heartbeat echoes, open sky  
oooooo  
iiiiii

[verse 1 - Bridge of Dreams]  
Step by step, the world unfolds  
Chasing whispers, tales untold  
Shadows fade, a new refrain  
Guided by the stars' soft glow  
aaaaaaa  

[Pre-Chorus - Horizon's Call]  
[soft rise]  
iiiiii  
With each step, the journey draws near  
Melody of hope, crystal clear

[Chorus - Leap of Glisar]  
wooooo  
iiiiiiii  
Rise with the dawn, embrace the light  
Heart and soul, take flight

[Bridge - Dreamscape]  
In the embrace of the night, we find our way  
Every note a promise, in the sky it stays  
Ahhhhhh  
[ethereal echo]

[verse 2]  
Stories weave through time and space  
Illuminating every place  
With a song, we transcend  
Together, until the end

[outro - Fade to Light]  
(soft voices) Path complete, echoes rest  
iiiiii  
Glisar's leap, our hearts' quest

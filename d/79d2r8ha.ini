lyrics = [intro - echoing winds]

[verse 1 - Shattered Remnants]
Hearts beat, empty rooms
Shadows crawl, past moments loom
ooooo iiiii

[Pre-Chorus - Hollow Pulse]
Echoes fade, whispers break
In the void, no escape

[Chorus - Mora's Call]
woooooo  
iiiiii
Lost in echoes, can't find the way
Heart's a void, night and day

[Bridge - Desolation]
Silent cries, shattered dreams
Beyond the light, nothing seems
ahhhh oooo

[verse 2 - Fading Echoes]
Steps retraced, paths undone
In the void, I'm the only one
ssssshhh

[outro - Mora's Echo]

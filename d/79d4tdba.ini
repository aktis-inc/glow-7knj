lyrics = [intro - Soft Glow]
(Soft voice) City lights in gentle dance
(Soft voice) Shadows whisper, heart's romance
oooooo  
mmmmmmmmm

[verse 1 – Wyrin's Whisper]
In the echoes of the night
Dreams unfold, take their flight
Gentle breeze, soft embrace
In this space, we find our place
sssshhhhh

[Pre-Chorus – Twilight Embrace]  
[whispered melody]
ooooooo
Between the silence and the sound
Every heartbeat feels profound

[Chorus – Dream Tide]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii

[Bridge - Neon Drift] 
We wander through the city's glow (together)
In the rhythm, time moves slow (forever)
Ahhhh mmmmmm  
[soft echoes]

[verse 2]
Lost in moments, time suspends
In this night, the journey bends
City hum, a lullaby
Underneath the starlit sky

[soft build-up]  
ooooo ssshhh  

[whispered voice] dreams… waves… serenity… (oo-yeah!)

[outro - Wyrin Waves]

[verse 1]
Bajo el cielo ardiente  
Las olas nos llaman  
En el horizonte, sueños flotan  
Tus ojos reflejan el sol

[Pre-Chorus - Ocean Breeze]  
oooooo  
Vamos a bailar, sin pensar  
El tiempo no nos puede alcanzar

[Chorus - Sunset Glow]  
iiiiiiii  
Horizontes aaaaahhhhh  
Seremos libres frente al mar

[Bridge - Tropical Echo]  
oooooo  
Luz y sombras, danzan  
Nuestros corazones, cantan

[outro - Fading Light]  
A la orilla del mundo  
Un último suspiro  
oooooo  
iiiiiiii

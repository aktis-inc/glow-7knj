[verse 1]
Rhythms dance in twilight
Echoes of the past, reborn
Beats in sync with stars

[bridge - festive pulse]
ooooo iiiii
Tradition whispers, future calls
Step by step, we weave

[chorus - Davana Flow]
Sway with the breeze, let go
iiiiii aaaa

[verse 2]
Colors blend, patterns unfold
Stories told in every note
Harmony in every breath

[outro - fading echoes]
oooooo aaaaaa
Into the night, we drift

(soft chimes) 

[verse 1]
In the veils of time, echoes call
Ancient chants, a spiritual thrall
ooooo oooooo 

[Chorus - Sitar's Dream]
Waves of truth, in the cosmic seam
iiiiii iiiiii

[Bridge - Tranquil Journey]
Through the lotus, we sail
With whispers, we prevail
aaaaaa aaaaaa

[outro - Eternal Flow]
(soft tabla and sitar fade)

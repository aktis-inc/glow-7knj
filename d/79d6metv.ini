lyrics = [intro synth wave]

[verse 1 – Analog Pulse]
In the heart of the circuit,
Where whispers hum in code,
We drift through digital echoes,
In a neon urban abode.

[Chorus – Electric Glide]
ooooo
iii ooooo
Call me from the static,
Where dreams and signals collide,
We’re lost in the electric tide.

[Bridge - Synth Surge]
Flowing through wires,
In a symphony of light,
Our voices intertwine,
In the endless night.

[outro - Fading Frequencies]
Echoes fade to silence,
A whisper in the void,
Our song, a fleeting resonance,
In the universe deployed.

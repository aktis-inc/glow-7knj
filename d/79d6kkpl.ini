ahhhh ooooooo

[verse 1 – Rhythmic Tale]  
In the heart of the city, where stories unfold  
Beats like waves, never growing old  
Dance through the night, with whispers bold  
oooooo

[Chorus – Endless Groove]  
Eyaaaa ooooo  
Move to the rhythm, let the night flow  
Stories in motion, let the world know

[Bridge - Pulse of Life]  
Tap into the heartbeat, feel it rise  
Colors and sounds, under open skies  
ahhhh

[outro - Never Ending Beat]  
iiiiiiii  
Endless rhythms under the moon's glow  
Dance till dawn, let the spirit grow

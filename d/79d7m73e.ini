[dhol rhythm build-up]
oooo
aaaa

[verse 1 - Shadow Play]
Beneath the lights, we gather here
Colors blend, whispers near
Dance of shadows, bright and clear
Festive night, hearts sincere
iiiiiiii

[Chorus – Neon Dance]
woooooo  
ooooo  
Dance, dance, oh illuminated shadows
Feel the beat, where the neon glows

[Bridge - Flute Interlude]
[flute and dhol solo]
sssssshhhhh
ooooo

[verse 2]
In the rhythm, stories unfold
Voices rise, bold and untold
Echoes of past, future foretold
Together we unite, hearts of gold

[outro - Festival Glow]
iiiiiiiii
Celebrate, oh illuminated shadows
Dance away, where the neon flows

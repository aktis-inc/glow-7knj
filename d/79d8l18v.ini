[verse 1 - Gentle Reflection]  
Echoes in the distance call  
Whispers of forgotten days  
In the soft light, shadows fall  
Memories in gentle haze  
ooooo

[Chorus - Heart's Murmur]  
Stay with me through the time's flow  
Where the dreams and stars align  
In the quiet, let love grow  
You're the echo in my mind  
iiiiiiiiii

[Bridge - Timeless Connection]  
Through the years, our paths entwine  
Silent vows in night's embrace  
In the echoes, love's design  
Guides us to our secret place  
ooooo ahhhh

[outro - Fading Light]  
woooooo  
iiiiiiiiii  
Stay...  
With me...

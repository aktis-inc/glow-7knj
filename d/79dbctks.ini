[verse]
Echoes in the storm,
Past lives reborn,
In the dance of light,
We find our flight.

[chorus - Lightning's Call]
oooooo  
iiiiiiiiii
Feel the lightning's call,
Through it all, we rise and fall.

[bridge - Celestial Dance]
A dance of stars,
Beyond the scars,
We find our way,
In the storm's ballet.

[outro - Echoes Fade]
wooooo  
iiiiiiiii
Storm's song fades away,
In echoes, we sway.

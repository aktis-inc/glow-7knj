Reflections dance in neon glow  
Through waves of sound we go  
Cities pulse with electric dreams

[bridge - Echo Reverie]  
woooooo aaahhh  
Harmonies in endless streams  

[chorus - Electric Surge]  
Pulse and rhythm, lights collide  
Feel the energy inside  
ooooo iiiii

[drop - Festival Frenzy]  
bass thumps, hands rise  
synth blips, crowd's reprise  

[outro - Echoing Fade]  
oooooo  
Reflections of the night

lyrics = [intro - soft awakening]

[verse 1 – Flicker]  
Whispers in the night  
Where dreams take flight  
Floating on a breeze  
Time's gentle tease

[chorus - Ignite]  
woooo oooo  
Flames of the heart  
Burn in the dark

[bridge - Connection]  
iiiiiii  
Two souls, one spark  
Amidst the arc

[verse 2 – Ember Glow]  
In shadows we dance  
A fleeting chance  
Through the echoes  
Where love grows

[outro - Fade to Light]  
ahhhh ahhhh  
Together we ignite  
In the quiet night

lyrics = [intro - city echo]

[verse]
Through shadows we wander,
Horizons twist and sway,
In rhythms of tomorrows,
The echoes softly play

[chorus - uplifting surge]
oooooo
Across the skyline's whisper,
We chase the light's embrace,
wooooo
In melodies of wonder,
We find our rightful place

[bridge - vibrant twist]
shhhhhhh
Among the stars we dance,
In cosmic threads we weave,
The echoes of our chance,
In every note, believe

[outro - fading horizon]
iiiiiiii
As shadows softly linger,
And dreams begin to soar,
The horizon's gentle finger,
Points to forevermore

[verse]
Silent echoes in the heart's chamber
Where whispers hold the truth untold
In shadows, love's tender ember
Burns bright as stories unfold
aaaa ooooooo

[chorus]
Swaying in the gentle breeze
Soft notes weave through the trees
Jaded whispers, gentle plea
In the silence, we find the key

[bridge]
Through misty hills and golden light
Our paths entwine, hearts take flight
oooooo iiiiiiiii

[outro]
In the echoes, we'll remain
A melody to soothe the pain

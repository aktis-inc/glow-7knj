lyrics = [intro - Neon Pulse]
oooooo  
evolving echoes in the night  

[verse 1 – Rhythmic Dance]  
In the city of neon dreams  
Your eyes met mine, a silent gleam  
We move to the beat, no words to say  
Our hearts in sync, we sway away  
ooooooo  

[Pre-Chorus – Rising Harmony]  
Feel the pulse, electric and true  
In this moment, just me and you  

[Chorus – Echoing Heartbeat]  
woooooo  
Shape of us, in the light  
oooooo  
Dancing through the night  

[verse 2]  
Stories told in our silent glance  
Lost in the rhythm, a chance romance  
Your laughter echoes in the air  
A melody that we both share  
shhhhhhh  

[Bridge - Neon Dreams]  
ooooo  
In the glow, we find our way  
ooooo  
Evolving echoes, here we'll stay  

[outro - Fade to Light]  
woooooo  
iiiiiiii  
Neon echoes, fading bright  
ooooo

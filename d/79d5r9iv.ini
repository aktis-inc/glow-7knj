iiiiiiiiiii

[verse 1]
In the shadows, I walked alone
Searching for a place to call my own
ooooo

[chorus]
Forgive the silence, forgive the storm
In your arms, I find my home
iiiiiiiiiii

[bridge]
Winds of time whisper your name
Hearts entwined, never the same
ahhhhhhh

[outro]
Lost in the journey, found in the embrace
Forgiveness as the guiding trace
oooooooooo

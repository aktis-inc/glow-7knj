[verse 1]  
In the quiet night, stars whisper stories  
Lonely roads call to the heart, old memories  
oooooo iiiiiii

[chorus]  
Solitude's echo, a dance in the shadows  
Hold me near, through the silent tomorrows  
iiiaaaahhhh

[bridge]  
Timeless whispers, in the cool night air  
Every step, a gentle prayer  
ooooo oooo

[verse 2]  
Beneath the tree, dreams softly reside  
In your arms, I find my guide  
zzzzzzhhhhh

[outro - fading whispers]  
Through the echoes, we walk side by side  
Solitude's echo, our hearts aligned

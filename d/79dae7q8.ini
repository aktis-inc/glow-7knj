lyrics = [intro - soaring echoes]

[verse 1 - Flight of the Champion]
Wings spread wide, reaching the sky
The heart beats to ancient drums
In the air, echoes of victory
Whisper tales of timeless triumph
oooooo aaaaaa iiiiii

[chorus - Harmony of the Winds]
oooo ooooo
Voices rise and fall, like waves
In unison, they call to the brave

[bridge - Rhythmic Ascent]
Steps of grace, in the dance of life
Carried by the winds, in endless flight
oh oh ahhh  
[echoes fade]

[verse 2 - Spirit of the Sky]
Colors blend in the vast expanse
Each note a story, each feather a chance
To be more than just a fleeting glance

[outro - Eternal Glide]
wwwoooo iiiii
In the sky, the champion's cry
A legacy that never dies

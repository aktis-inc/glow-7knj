lyrics = [intro whisper]
Gentle light, sapphire sky  
Emotions flow, passing by  
iiiiiiiiiiii  

[verse 1]  
Through the hues of yesterday  
We find the words we couldn’t say  
Each note a step, each chord a sigh  
In this kaleidoscope we lie  
ooooooo  

[Chorus – Echoed Reflections]  
Sapphire dreams, in the night  
Guide our way, gentle light  
wooooooo  

[Bridge - Heartstrings]  
Through the strands of time we weave  
Every glance a silent reprieve  
Ahhhh eeeeee  

[outro - Fade to Calm]  
In this moment, we find peace  
As the echoes softly cease  
oooooo iiiiii

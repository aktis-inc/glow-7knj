lyrics = [intro - Ocean's Whisper]
wooooooo  
gentle echoes

[verse 1 - Heart's Call]
In shadows cast by yesterdays  
A whisper calls from distant waves  
Oooooo  
Through time, our bond remains

[chorus - Eternal Link]
Ancient echoes, ooooo  
Binding threads, unseen  
Soul's tapestry, woven tight  
In dreams, we're evergreen  
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

[bridge - Resonate]
Feel the pulse of hidden ties  
Beneath the vast, unending skies  
Aaaaaa  
Our song, forever flies

[outro - Fading Light]
Waves crash, the sun dips low  
In our silence, love will grow  
wooooooo  
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

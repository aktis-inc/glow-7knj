mmmmmmmm  
[verse 1 - Golden Hour]
In the city's gentle breath  
We find a rhythm, a soft caress  
Every note a whisper, every chord a touch  
ooooo  
[Pre-Chorus - Heartbeat]
In this space, where time slows down  
Our souls entwine, in sound profound  
iiiiiiii  
[Chorus - Soulful Connection]
waaaaavellllll  
Here we are, in harmony  
In the light, we find our peace  
[Bridge - Twilight Glow]
Underneath the fading sun  
Our hearts a melody, as one  
shhhhhhh  
[verse 2 - Echoed Moments]
Through the night, our voices weave  
In the quiet, we believe  
ooooo  
[outro - Wavell Harmony]
oooooo  
Softly, we drift, in harmony

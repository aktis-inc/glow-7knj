lyrics = [intro - gentle breeze]

[soft chant] 
ahhhhhhhhh  
iiiiiiiiiiii  
oooooo 

[verse - twilight whispers]
In the hush of evening light  
Lanterns glow, spirits take flight  
Harmony of the soul's embrace  
In sacred silence, find your place  

[mystical interlude]
oooooo

[chorus - celestial call]
Ethereal notes in the air  
Solis breathes a tranquil prayer  
In the heart of stillness found  
Mystic echoes, all around  

[bridge - serene descent]
Whispers of a gentle stream  
Flow through the quiet dream  
In the temple of our minds  
Peaceful solitude, intertwined  

[soft outro]
ahhhhhhh  
oooooo  
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

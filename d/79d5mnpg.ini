lyrics = [intro - Soft Whisper]
(Soft guitar strum)  
ooooooo  
iiiaaaa

[verse 1 - Hidden Paths]  
In sapphire dreams we wander  
Secrets hidden in the light  
A world unknown and tender  
Where day turns into night  
shhhhhhh

[Chorus - Dreamscape]  
oooooo  
iiiii

[Bridge - Echoes of Blue]  
Through sapphire skies we fly  
Lost in the gentle sigh  
Of whispers that never die  
ahhhhhhh

[verse 2 - Beneath the Stars]  
We find the stories untold  
In the shadows of the old  
Together we unfold  
A tale of dreams and gold

[outro - Fading Light]  
ooooooo  
(Soft piano fade)

[verse 1 – Tradition Meets Future]
In the fields of gold, dreams unfold
Past whispers with the new
Bandana wrapped around our souls
The rhythm pulls us through
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[Pre-Chorus – Cultural Pulse]  
[soft echo]
ooooooooh
Tradition in our veins, future in our eyes
The world spins, we rise

[Chorus – Fusion Beat]  
woooooo  
iiiiiiii

[Bridge - Heritage Flow] 
Old meets new, in the dance of time
The beats align, our spirits climb
Ahhhh shshshsh  
[echoed harmony]

[verse 2]
Colors blend in the vibrant sky
Legacy and dreams collide
Our voices soar, reaching high

[glitch build-up]  
ssshhhh oooo  

[whispered chant] we are the bridge of time… (oo-yeah!)

[outro - Harmony Drift]

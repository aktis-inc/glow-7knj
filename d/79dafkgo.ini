lyrics = [intro - Ignition]

[verse 1]
Fires blaze across the city
Voices rise, a call to arms
In shadows, we find our unity
Breaking chains, defying harm
ooooo  
zzzzzhhhhh

[Chorus - Ember's Call]
iiiiiiii  
Flames of rebellion burn bright  
We rise in the night  
No longer in flight

[Bridge - Inferno]
Roaring engines, hearts ignite  
Our story written against the light  
Echoes of freedom, our eternal fight

[outro - Ashes]
In the ashes, we find our way  
ooooo  
To a new dawn, where we stay  
zzzzzzzzhhhhh

(Soulful hum) ooooo  
(Harmonized vocals) Sacred echoes  
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

[verse 1 – Divine Calling]  
In the shadows of the stars  
Silent whispers, hearts ajar  
Feel the light, let it in  
Sacred echoes from within  
oooooohhhhh

[Chorus – Celestial Waves]  
oooooo  
Hallelujah, hear the call  
Feel the rise, never fall  
wooooooo  

[Bridge - Eternal Light]  
In the night, we find grace  
Every heartbeat, a sacred space  
Ahhhh shhhhhh  
[soft bells]

[verse 2]  
Beyond the veil, in the light  
Every soul, takes its flight  
Echoes of eternity, in the night

[outro - Heavenly Fade]  
ssshhhh oooo  
[whispered prayer] ooooohhh  
[echoing harmonies]

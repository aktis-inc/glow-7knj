[verse 1]
In the golden sands, where stories dance
Tradition whispers through every glance
oooooo aaaaa

[chorus - Joyful Parade]
Dance in the sun, let the rhythms run
Echoes of the land, where the heartbeats drum
iiiiiiiiii

[bridge - Desert Whirl]
Spirits rise, beneath the endless skies
Colors blend, where dreams never end
oooooo wooooo

[outro - Sunset Celebration]
Azure dreams, in the desert gleams
Songs of old, in voices bold
aaaaaaa iiiiiii]

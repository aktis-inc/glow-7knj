lyrics = [intro beat]

[verse]  
Brass shines in the night
On a road without end
Echoes of the city
In every twist and bend

[chorus]  
oooooo  
Ride the rhythm, feel the flow  
iiiiii  
Through the streets, let it go

[bridge]  
Power in motion, sound and light  
Feel it rising, taking flight  
aaaaa

[outro - fade]  
The road calls, a distant hum  
oooo  
In the night, where dreams run free

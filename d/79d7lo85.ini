lyrics = [intro - Whispering Skies]
(Synthesized voice) Beneath sapphire skies  
(Synthesized voice) Echoes of dreams  
oooooo  
iiiiiii

[verse 1 – Sapphire Reflection]  
In twilight's grasp, I find my way  
A path of hues in soft array  
Each note a whisper, each chord a sigh  
Guided by stars in the indigo sky  
oooooo

[Pre-Chorus – Heart's Echo]  
[gentle rise]  
Softly we wander, where dreams reside  
In the calm embrace of the night tide

[Chorus – Twilight's Serenade]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiiiii

[Bridge - Eternal Drift]  
Let the sapphire light lead on  
In its glow, shadows are gone  
Ahhhhhh  
[echoed breath]

[verse 2]  
Through the silent waves of thought  
A journey where the soul is caught  
Lost in the warmth of evening’s glow

[outro - Fading Echoes]  
oooooo  
iiiiiiiii  
[soft fade]

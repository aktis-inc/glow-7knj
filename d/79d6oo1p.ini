[verse 1 - Moonlit Reverie]
In the shadow of the moon's grace  
Veena strings whisper the past  
Eternal hymns embrace the night  
Where time stands still, hearts contrast

[chant - Sacred Echo]
Aaaa ooooo  
Sooo naaa  

[bridge - Mystical Journey]
In the dance of stars, we find our way  
Mridangam beats like ancient hearts  
The soul's quest in a timeless play  
Where silence speaks and wisdom starts

[outro - Fade into Dawn]
Ooooooo  
Ahhh naaaa  
Eternal echoes, night departs

lyrics = [intro]
[verse 1 – Fire Dance]
Flames rise high, city in the night
Banjo strings echo, under the streetlight
ooooooo  
iiiiiiiiiiiiii   

[chorus – Freedom Cry]
Through the fire, we find our way
Breaking chains, night into day
woooooooo  
oooooo

[verse 2 – Rebel Pulse]
We ride the storm, hearts untamed
Voices loud, we can't be chained
zzzzzzhhhhhh 

[bridge – Blaze Break]
Ashes fall, but we stand tall
In the heat, we hear the call
Ahhhhhh shhhhhh

[outro – Ember Drift]
Burn the past, let it go
In the fire, we find our soul
wooooooo

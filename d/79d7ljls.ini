wooooooo
iiiiiiiiii

[verse 1 – Echoes]
In the shadows, colors dance
Kaleidoscope dreams, a trance
Every beat a whispered chance
Through the echoes, we advance

[Drop - Ultra Bass]
oooooo aaaaa iiiii

[Chorus – Pulse Drive]
Deep in the night, where echoes meet
Bass lines guide the rhythm's feat
Through the kaleidoscope we greet
The echoes of our hearts' beat

[Bridge - Digital Mirage]
shhhh aaaa
In the city lights, we find
Patterns in the endless grind
wooooooo

[verse 2]
Through the neon, we explore
A world of echoes, forevermore
Bass vibrations, to the core
Our hearts echo, wanting more

[glitch build-up]
oooooo ssshhhh

[outro - Fading Echo]
iiiiiiiiiiii
Echoes fade into the night
Kaleidoscope dreams take flight

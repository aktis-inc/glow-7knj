lyrics = [intro - Thunderous Start]
ooooo
i am the storm

[verse 1 - Relentless Flow]
quiet flows the fury, unleash the beast
pounding footsteps, my heart's at its feast
each breath a battle cry, in the gym I rise
power unleashed, fire in my eyes

[Chorus - Unyielding Drive]
wooooo
keep pushing through
no room for defeat, it's you vs you

[Bridge - Adrenaline Surge]
pulse quickens, rise to the challenge
muscles scream, never lose balance
ahhhhhhh

[verse 2 - Commanding Presence]
echoes of sweat, echoes of might
every drop fuels the fight
push harder, break the mold
in this arena, legends are told

[Outro - Victory Anthem]
ooooooo
the fight is never over, the story unfolds

lyrics = [intro - gentle awakening]

[soft echoing whispers]

oooooo  
iiiiiiii

[verse - Lost Traces]
Drifting through the silent waves  
Luminous paths that softly fade  
In the dance of light, we sway  
Echoes in the night, they stay  
zzzzzz

[ambient swell]

[whispered chorus]
Through the ether, lost in dreams  
Where the shadows softly gleam  
oooooooo  

[bridge - Tranquil Flow]  
Calmness in the silent stream  
A world where nothing's what it seems  
Ahhhhhh  

[outro - fading whispers]  
Softly, gently, we drift away  
Into the quiet of the day  
sssssshhhh

lyrics = [intro - Distant Whispers]
shhhhhhhh  

[verse 1 – City Shadows]  
In these streets, the echoes cry  
Beneath the umber sky, we sigh  
Silent screams of yesterdays  
Lost in dreams, in faded ways  
ooooooooo  

[Pre-Chorus – Rising Tide]  
ooooooo  
Whispers in the dark, they guide  
Through the storm, we coincide  

[Chorus – Echoes of Umber]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiiiii  
In the night, our voices soar  
Breaking through, forevermore  

[Bridge - Urban Maze]  
Lost in shadows, finding light  
In the maze, we fight the night  
sssshhhhh ahhhhhhhh  

[verse 2]  
Through the chaos, we persist  
In the umber mist, we exist  
Beneath the city’s gentle glow  
We find our way, we start to grow  

[outro - Fading Light]  
iiiiiiii  
As the echoes fade away  
In the night, we find our way  
oooooo

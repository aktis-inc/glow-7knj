[verse]  
In the midst of twilight's glow  
Whispers of dreams softly flow  
oooooo

[chorus - River's Embrace]  
iiiiii  
Softly echo through the night  
Rivers carry gentle light

[bridge - Zephyr's Call]  
Wind's gentle touch, soft caress  
Past emotions, no distress

[verse]  
Memories dance on the breeze  
Time stands still with such ease  
ooooooo

[outro - Fading Echoes]  
Rivers sing the song of old  
In their arms, secrets they hold  
iiiiiiii

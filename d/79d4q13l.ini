[verse 1 – Echoes of Tradition]
Strings weave tales of old
In the heart of the city, tales unfold
oooooo

[Pre-Chorus – Urban Symphony]
Rhythmic beats, stories collide
In every note, the past resides
iiiiii

[Chorus – Daven's Echo]
wooooooo  
Tradition in every breath
Future in every step

[Bridge - Cultural Fusion]
Dance of history, dance of light
In this city, dreams take flight
shhhhhh

[verse 2]
Melodies that time forgot
In every corner, a new thought
aaaaa

[outro - Fade to Tomorrow]
ooooo
fiery horizon…

lyrics = [intro - City Echoes]

[verse 1]
In the night, where shadows linger  
Whispers of the heart grow stronger  

[Chorus]
ooooo  
Confessions in harmony  
iiiiii  
In this urban symphony  

[Bridge - Dusk Reverie] 
oooooo  
zzzzzzhhhhh  
Softly, the city breathes  

[verse 2]
Echoes tell tales of longing  
Through the streets, melodies drifting  

[glitch fade]  
oooo  
[Outro - Harmony's Embrace]

lyrics = [intro dreamwave]

[verse 1 – Ethereal Echoes]
Under the neon sky, reflections collide
In glass and dreams, where whispers reside
oooooo iiiiiii

[Chorus – City Pulse]
Kaleidoscope dreams, we fly
Through colors and time, we sigh
woooooooo

[Bridge – Urban Serenade]
Glimmers of hope, in shadows we find
A dance of light, in the corners of mind
ahhhhhh shhhhhhh

[Verse 2]
Through the labyrinth of sound, we wander
In the city's heart, we ponder
zzzzz

[Outro – Fade to Dawn]
As dawn breaks, dreams linger
In the light, we find our singer
ooooooo iiiiiiiii

lyrics = [intro mist]
(Whispering echoes) sssshhhh
(Mystical chant) oooooo

[verse 1 – Shadows Dance]
In the mists, they rise
Secrets woven in silence
Eyes watch from beyond
The veils of reality

[Chant – Ethereal Echo]
iiiiiiiiii
oooooo

[build-up – Tribal Pulse]  
(drumming intensifies)  
Feel the rhythm awaken

[Chorus – Spirits' Whisper]  
ooooohhh  
Mysteries unfold  
In the dance of the night

[Bridge – Hidden Realms]  
(whispered chants)  
They call to us  
Through time and space  
aaaaaaa

[outro – Fade into Dreams]
(ssshhhh)
Return to the shadows  
Until we meet again...

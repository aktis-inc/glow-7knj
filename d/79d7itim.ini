shhhhhhh  
[raindrop echoes]

[verse]
beneath the sky's soft tears  
whispers of thunder call  
gentle as night's embrace  
we drift in nature's thrall  
oooooo

[soft chorus]
iiiiiiii  
calm serenity reigns  
shhhhhhh

[bridge]
in the echoes, we find  
peaceful dreams, intertwined  
oooooo

[outro]
rustling leaves, faded light  
in this storm, we unite  
shhhhhhh

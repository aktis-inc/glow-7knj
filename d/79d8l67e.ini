lyrics = [intro - wave splash]
(cheerful synth)  
Sunrise glow, hearts in flight  
(friends' laughter echoes)

[verse 1 - Horizon Bloom]
Golden sands beneath our feet  
Dreams and laughter, time to greet  
With every wave, we find our beat  
ooooooo

[Pre-Chorus - Sea Breeze]
Hands held high, touching sky  
In this moment, we can fly  
iiiiiiiiiiiiii

[Chorus - Joyful Tide]
Dance beneath the sunlit sky  
Love and laughter, soaring high  
woooooo

[Bridge - Sunset Glow]
Together, we paint the day  
Colors of love in our own way  
ahhhhhh

[outro - Horizon Fade]
As the sun dips in the sea  
Our hearts are light, wild and free  
(soft laughter fades)

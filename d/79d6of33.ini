[verse]
In the shifting sands of time
Memories entwine, like threads of silk
Whispers of forgotten dreams
Echo in the silent night

[chorus]
Kaleidoscope of memories
Turning, turning, never still
Colors blend and fade away
Yet their warmth forever stays

In this dance of time and space
Hear the echoes, feel the grace
Oooooo iiiiiii
Ahhhh

[outro]
ooooooooo
iiiiiiii
[fade]

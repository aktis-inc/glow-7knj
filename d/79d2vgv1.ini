lyrics = [intro - city whispers]

[verse - Desert Glow]
Melodies dance in the air, ancient tales told anew
Through the streets of light, we wander, dreams in view

[chorus - Harmonic Breeze]
oooo iiiiii
Voices rise, in echoes, a timeless song
In unity, we find where we belong

[bridge - Oasis Reflection]
The rhythm of the night, a heartbeat strong
Traditions and futures, we weave along

[outro - Horizon's Call]
iiiiiiii aaaa
Echoes fade into the dawn, whispers of tomorrow

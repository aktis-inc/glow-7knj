[verse 1]
In the garden of stars, we wander
Through nebulae that softly glow
Our hearts find their gentle thunder
In this cosmic afterglow
aaaaa

[chorus]
We dance in the nebula garden
Our dreams as vast as the skies
Together our spirits are hardened
In the light where love never dies
ooooo

[bridge]
Cosmic winds whisper secrets
To the blooms that never fade
In this universe, our duet
We find the love we've made

[outro]
harmonizing in starlight
ooooo
iiiiiiii

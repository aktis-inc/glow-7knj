[verse 1 â€“ Neon Glow]
In the city of lights, where shadows dance,  
Silent whispers float on the breeze,  
Electric dreams in a digital trance,  
We move with ease, through neon trees.

[Pre-Chorus â€“ Pulse Beat]  
Through the streets, our spirits roam,  
Connected hearts in the unknown,  
ooooo iiiiii

[Chorus â€“ Electric Surge]  
Sparks unseen, ignite the night,  
In this city, we take flight,  
wooooooo  
ooooooo

[Bridge - Hologram Dreams] 
Glowing paths, we walk as one,  
In this world, weâ€™ve just begun,  
Ahhhhhh shhhh

[verse 2 â€“ Urban Pulse]
Cities hum with vibrant life,  
In this dream, we lose the strife,  
Together we create our space,  
In this rhythm, find our place,  

[glitch build-up]  
ooooo iiiii

[outro â€“ Digital Fade]
In the glow, we find our way,  
Through the night, to break of day,  
ooooo iiiii

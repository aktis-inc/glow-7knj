lyrics = [intro - Dreams Whisper]
oooooo  
[verse 1 – City Pulse]  
In the city lights, we find our way  
Dreams entwined, like shadows play  

[Pre-Chorus – Echo Dance]  
oooooo  
Chasing whispers, heartbeats race  
Through the night, we embrace  

[Chorus – Dream Chaser]  
woooo  
iiiiiii  
We are the echoes of our dreams  
Running through these moonlit streams  

[Bridge - Soul's Call]  
The night sings our melodies  
In this dance of destinies  

[outro - Fading Lights]  
ooooooo  
Chasing through dreams, where starlight gleams

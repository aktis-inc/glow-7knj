[verse 1]
The seagull flies to distant shores
Beyond the edge where dreams soar
oooooo iiiiiii

[chorus - soaring high]
Blue eyes see the endless sky
Waves of time softly pass by
wooooooo

[bridge - horizon's call]
Gentle whispers in the breeze
Freedom found beyond the seas
ahhhhh

[outro - fade to sunset]
The journey eternal, the flight divine
In the heart of the sea, forever mine

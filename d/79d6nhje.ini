lyrics = [intro riff]

[verse 1]  
In the city lights, shadows call  
Heroes rise, never to fall  
oooooo  

[Pre-Chorus]  
With courage in their veins  
They break the chains, embrace the flames  

[Chorus]  
Together we stand, in the night we fight  
ooooo iiiii  

[Bridge]  
Bound by honor, bound by fate  
Never too early, never too late  
Ahhhh  

[verse 2]  
Through the darkness, through the pain  
Their spirit soars, like a hurricane  

[outro - Heroic Echo]  
Rise, rise, rise... (ooooo iiiii)

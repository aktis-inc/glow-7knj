lyrics = [intro - digital hum]
[verse - gentle rise]  
Underneath the echoes, whispers of the night  
Colors blend in harmony, a city in flight  

[chorus - vibrant pulse]  
ooooo  
Dance of light and shadow, rhythm takes control  
Electric dreams awaken, hearts begin to roll  

[bridge - interlude]  
shhhhhh  
In the fusion of the old and new  
A melody of life comes through  

[outro - fading light]  
iiiiiiii  
The echoes fade, but the city stays alive  
oooooo  
Underneath the echoes, we thrive

[verse 1]
vvvvvvv
Colors spin in chaos
Lost in the storm's embrace
Each drop a whisper, a secret place
iiiiiii

[Chorus - Dance of Winds]
oooooo
Dance with the tempest, unfurling dreams
Traditions clash, a vibrant stream

Echoes of dhol, heartbeats align
In the eye of the storm, we find our line

Traditional meets the bold
Stories untold, mysteries unfold
oooooo

[outro - Calm Descent]
wwwwww
In stillness, echoes fade
A dance eternal, unafraid

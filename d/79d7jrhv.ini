Ssssssshhhhhh

[verse 1 - Forest Whispers]
In the jade glow, secrets untold
Echoes of ages, mysteries unfold
Oooooooo

Jadu flows, through the air
Bondhu calls, beyond compare
Aaaaaaahhhhhh

In rhythms ancient, stories collide
Voices entwined, on a timeless ride
Iiiiiiiiiii

Through the leaves, we drift away
In the magic, we choose to stay
Ssssshhhhhh oooooooo

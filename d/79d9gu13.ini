lyrics = [intro - Dusty Horizon]
(acoustic strum) ohhhh

[verse 1 – Echoing Silence]
The road unfolds, my shadow's tale  
In the whispers of the breeze  
Every mile a story untold  
Lost in the dusty seas  

[chorus – Grit and Grace]  
woooooo  
I'm the echo of my past  
iiiiii  
As the sun sets, I find my path  

[bridge - Soul's Reflection]  
In the mirror of the night  
My heart beats in quiet flight  

[outro - Fading Light]
(soft harmonica) ooooooo  
iiiiiiiiii

[verse 1]  
In the field of dreams, we play  
Chase the stars, hear them say  
oooooo  

[chorus - Game On]  
Energy bursts, we run  
Into the heart of the sun  
ze-ze-zephyr!  
iiiiii  

[bridge - Victory Chant]  
Feel the pulse, feel the rise  
Through the crowd, see the prize  
woooo oooo  

[outro - The Final Whistle]  
The echo of dreams, they call  
In the rhythm of the ball

[verse 1]
In shadows, whispers weave
A tapestry unseen
Dreams in gentle sway
Through echoes, they convene  
oooooo

[Pre-Chorus - Veil of Time]
sssshhh
iiiiii  
Silence speaks, secrets unfold
In the night, they softly hold

[Chorus - Dream Drift]
wooooo  
iiiiii
Through the veils, we glide
Beyond the bounds of night

[Bridge - Ethereal Path]
Rustling leaves, a hidden trace
In this realm, we find our place

[verse 2]
Vines entwine, in shadowed hues
A dance of light, a mystic muse

[outro - Whispering Echoes]
ssshhhh
Through the mist, our echoes fade
In the tapestry we've made

lyrics = [intro - gentle waves]
  
[verse 1]
Softly gliding on the breeze
Melodies wash over me
ooooo aaaaa

[chorus - wave's embrace]
Every sound, a gentle tide
Whispered secrets in the night
iiiiiii iiiiii

[verse 2]
Guitar strings weave through the air
Echoes linger everywhere
oooooo ooooo

[bridge - serene flow]
Floating on the ocean's call
Dreams awaken, standing tall
ahhhh ahhhh

[outro - fading light]
iiiiii ooooo
Waves recede, the day is done
Sinking with the setting sun

lyrics = [intro - Cosmic Echo]
ooooo

[verse 1 - Stellar Flow]
Stars align, my mind's a map
Lost in space, no turning back
Dreams collide, in cosmic tracks
iiiiiiiiii

[chorus - Nebula Pulse]
wooooo  
Lost in the sound, floating around
In the dark, where light's unbound

[bridge - Astro Lament]
Gravity fades, I drift away
Words like comets, in disarray
shhhhhhh

[verse 2 - Orbit's Edge]
Echoes of time, in silence scream
Galaxies spin, like vivid dreams
ooooo

[outro - Celestial Drift]
Drift away on stellar streams

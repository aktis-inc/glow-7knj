[verse - Whispering Streams]  
Soft echoes in the night  
Dancing dreams, gentle sighs  
iiiiiiiiiiiiii  

[Pre-Chorus - Eternal Whispers]  
ooooooo  
In the silence, hearts align  
Melodies entwined, timeless  

[Chorus - Celestial Embrace]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii  
Through the ages, love's refrain  

[Bridge - Starlit Paths]  
Guided by the moon's soft glow  
Winding paths where lovers go  
ahhhhhh

ooooo shhhhh  
Fading into the serene night  
Forever in Quella Harmony

[verse]
The sun kisses the earth,  
echoes of tradition,  
where dhol meets the heart,  
vibrations in motion.  

[chorus]
ooooo  
iiiiiiiii  
Dance beneath the open sky,  
where joy and rhythm unify.  

[bridge]
Colors burst,  
spirits rise,  
in this dance,  
we find our ties.  

[drop]
ooooo  
iiiii  
Ride the waves of sound,  
where heartbeats are unbound.  

[outro]
Rhythms under the sun,  
a journey just begun.

lyrics = [intro - Whispering Breeze]

[verse - Gentle Harmony]
Under moonlit skies, we find our way  
Silent stars above, guide our sway  

[Pre-Chorus - Soft Glow]
Hearts in rhythm, echoes of time  
In this embrace, our souls align  

[Chorus - Serene Encounter]
ooooo  
iiiiii  
Together we dream, in this gentle night  
Serene encounter, where love takes flight  

[Bridge - Dreamy Steps]
Dancing shadows, in the garden's light  
Every glance, a promise bright  

[verse - Tender Echo]
Whispered secrets, in the night's embrace  
Timeless moments, we gently trace  

[outro - Fading Echo]
ooooo  
iiiii  
In a moonlit garden, our hearts remain  
Serene encounter, love's sweet refrain

lyrics = [intro - gentle wave]

[verse - Yarev's Call]
Strings whisper tales, unseen paths unfold
Voices dance, in moonlit serenade

[chorus - Harmony's Embrace]
oooooo
Feel the pulse, heart's quiet song
iiiiiiii

[bridge - Echoes of Time]
In every note, stories untold
Together we soar, across the night

[verse - Resonant Souls]
Tabla taps, a heartbeat's echo
Guitar strums, weaving dreams

[outro - Yarev's Harmony]
oooooo
Softly fading, into the dawn
iiiiiiii

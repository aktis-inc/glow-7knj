lyrics = [intro]
Flute whispers in the dawn light  
oooooo  
City hum beneath the stars  
iiiiiiiiiiii  

[verse 1 – Urban Echo]  
In the shadows of the stories untold  
Where the streets breathe dreams of old  
ooooo  
They walk the path of whispered secrets  
In the rhythm of life, they unfold  
zzzzz  

[chorus – Rise of Waves]  
Underneath the waves, they flow  
Through the tides of time, they grow  
ahhhhh  
In the dance of night and day  
Their stories echo, far away  
oooooo  

[bridge – Cultural Tides]  
Ancient voices in the city's heart  
They weave the threads of every part  
shhhhhhh  
Flute and drum, a timeless art  
In the pulse of the earth, they start  
oooo  

[outro – Fade to Dawn]  
Beneath the waves, the stories stay  
In every rhythm, they find their way  
oooooo  
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

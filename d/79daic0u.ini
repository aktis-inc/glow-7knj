ooooo  
(synth)  

[verse 1 – Echoed Desire]  
In this city, shadows play  
Desires hidden, come what may  
Soft whispers in the night, they sway  
oooooo  

[Pre-Chorus - Pulse of Dreams]  
Feel the rhythm, let it guide  
Yearning hearts, can't hide  
ooooooo  
iiiiiiii  

[Chorus – Electric Yearning]  
wooooooo  
Set the genie free  
In this melody  
Feel the energy  
iiiiii  

[Bridge - Neon Reflection]  
shhhhh  
In neon glow, our secrets lie  
Dance beneath the urban sky  
ooooo  

[verse 2 – Whispered Promises]  
Promises linger in the air  
In the glow, we dare  
To dream, to feel, to care  
zzhhhhhh  

[outro - Desire's Echo]  
iiiiii  
shhhhh  
ooooo

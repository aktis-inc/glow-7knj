lyrics = [intro - City Pulse]

[verse]
Rhythms of the dawn  
Colors dance in air  
Dreams that breathe  
In the city glare  
ooooooohhh

[Pre-Chorus - Dream Sway]
ahhhh iiiiii  
Echoes whisper, souls unite  
In this endless night  

[Chorus - Vibrant Rise]  
oooooo  
Dance in the light  
Feel the heartbeat  
Pulse of the night

[Bridge - Urban Flow]  
Streets alive, vibrant glow  
Harmonies weave, let it flow  
ahhhh eeeee

[verse 2]
Chasing shadows, finding light  
In the dreamscape, endless flight  
iiiiiiiiiii

[outro - Dream Fade]
Echoes linger, night won't fade  
Dreams we chase, in the light parade

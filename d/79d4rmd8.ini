Feel the sun, feel the beat  
Dance with the waves, feel the heat  
ooooo  
iiiiiiiiiiii

[verse 1 – Island Vibes]
Tropical dreams, colors alive  
In the rhythm, we thrive  
Joyful hearts, endless skies  
Where the ocean meets the sunrise  
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[Pre-Chorus – Vibrant Pulse]  
[upbeat rhythm]
oooooo  
Move with the breeze, sway with ease  
Every moment, a tropical tease

[Chorus – Lumino Groove]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii

[Bridge – Sunset Dance]  
Colors blend, night descends (oh yeah!)  
In this dance, time transcends (let's go!)
ahhhh ahhhh  
[echoed laughter]

[verse 2]
Feel the pulse, island sound  
In this groove, we are bound  
Hearts alight, spirits free  
Dance with us, in unity

[build-up beat]  
ssshhhh oooo  

[outro – Groove to the Horizon]

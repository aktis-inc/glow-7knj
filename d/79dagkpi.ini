lyrics = [intro spark]

[verse 1 – Flickering Shadows]
In the night, whispers ignite
Words like embers, they take flight
Carried by winds unknown
To lands where fire has grown

[Chorus – Blaze of Voices]
oooooo  
In flames, we find our sound
Burning whispers all around
Fiiiiirrrreeee

[Bridge - Ember Pulse]
Drumming hearts, a rhythm true
Echoes dance, a world anew
Ahhhhhh  
[echoing beat]

[verse 2]
Through ashes, we create
A melody to liberate
Sparks fly in the dark
A symphony to mark

[glitch build-up]  
sssshhhh oooo  

[Pre-Chorus - Inferno Rise]
ooooo  
Our voices won't be tamed
In the fire, we're unchained

[outro - Ember's Echo]
[soft whisper] We rise... (oo-yeah!)

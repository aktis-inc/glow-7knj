lyrics = [intro - Serenity Flow]
oooooo iiiiiii

[verse 1 - Bonding Threads]  
In the gentle breeze, whispers of kin  
Golden threads, tied in love's knot  
oooooo   
iiiiiii

[chorus - Festival Glow]  
Embrace the light, celebrate the bond  
Hearts aligned, in timeless song  
oooooo   
iiiiiii

[instrumental - Sitar & Flute Dance]  
plucked strings flutter, wind carries dreams

[verse 2 - Timeless Ties]  
Hands weave stories, tales of old  
In this embrace, warmth unfolds

[outro - Harmony's Echo]  
Shadows fade, echoes remain  
In the stillness, bonds sustain  
oooooo iiiiiii]

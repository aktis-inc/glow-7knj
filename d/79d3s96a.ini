lyrics = [intro - Echoing Chords]
whispers of the city waking  
oooooo

[verse 1 - Urban Pulse]  
Questions linger in the air  
Every heartbeat, a silent prayer  
Walking through shadows of doubt

[Pre-Chorus - Rising Tide]  
oooooo  
Lift the veil, see the horizon  
Underneath the open sky

[Chorus - Waver's Call]  
wooooo  
What’s up, echoes resonate  
In the heart's hidden landscape  
iiiiiii  

[Bridge - Reflective Path]  
In the city's breath, I find my way  
Every step, a story to convey  
ahhh shhhh

[verse 2 - Heartfelt Journey]  
Dreams like stars, guiding the night  
Voices blend, in the city's light  
Seeking truth in whispered tones

[outro - Waver's Echo]  
ooooo  
iiiiiiii  
Fade into the city's embrace

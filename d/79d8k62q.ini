lyrics = [intro - soft echo]

[verse 1 - Whispered Shadows]  
In the mist, memories linger  
Fading dreams, soft as whispers  
oooooo  
iiiiiiii  

[Chorus - Resonant Heartbeat]  
wooooooo  
In echoes, we find our truth  
Lost yet found, in the quiet  

[Bridge - Dream's Edge]  
Through silence, voices call  
A journey within, beyond all

[outro - Fading Light]  
oooooo  
iiiiiiii  
The past, a gentle lullaby  
Resonance of echoes, sigh

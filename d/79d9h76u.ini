[verse 1 – Storm Murmurs]
In the heart of the tempest's embrace  
Whispers weave tales of old  
Dancing shadows in the rain's race  
Stories of wonder, bold  
ooooo iiiii  

[Chorus – Thunder's Call]  
Roaring skies, echoing dreams  
Tradition's pulse in rhythmic streams  
Lively beats, the storm's refrain  
Uniting hearts through joy and pain  
woooooo aaaaaaaa  

[Bridge – Cultural Fusion]  
Past and future in a swirl  
Voices blend, emotions whirl  
Echoes of the earth and sky  
In this storm, we fly high  
zzzzzzzzhhhhh  

[outro - Calm Descent]  
As the storm fades away  
Harmony in the light of day  
iiiiiiii ooooooo

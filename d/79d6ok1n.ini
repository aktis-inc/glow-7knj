oooooo  
ssssssss

[verse 1 - Mystic Call]
In the shadow of the dunes
Secrets dance with the moon
Voices of the past echo 
Through the sands, they flow

[chorus - Ethereal Waves]
oooooo  
nnnnnn  
Let the stars guide the way
In the night, we sway

[bridge - Whispering Sands]
sssssshhhhh  
Mysteries unfold in time
A dance of rhythm and rhyme

[outro - Fade into Horizon]
oooooo  
nnnnnn  
Endless journey, eternal night

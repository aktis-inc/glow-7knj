Skylines whisper through the night
Colors collide, in vibrant light

Catch the rhythm, take the ride
Every heartbeat, electrified

Dance with the stars, in harmony

Feel the energy, let it flow
In the city, where dreams glow

Steps align, on the concrete stage
Every moment, a turning page

[outro - Fade to Neon]
The night fades, but memories stay
In Haval Harmony, we sway

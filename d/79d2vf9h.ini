iiiii

[verse 1 – Cultural Dance]
Gamelan speaks of tales untold,
Rhythms weave through the crowd,
Echoes of the past, alive and bold,
Feel the pulse, proud and loud.

[Pre-Chorus – Tradition's Beat]
Dance to the beat of ancient calls,
ooooo
In every step, history falls.

[Chorus – Harmony's Embrace]
Elara sings in the breeze,
wwwoooooo
iiiiii

[Bridge – Modern Fusion]
New beats blend with old,
Stories in each note unfold,
Ahhhhhh
Shhhhhhh

[verse 2 – Joyful Journey]
Paths of color, paths of sound,
In this dance, we're unbound,
Feel the harmony all around.

[glitch build-up]
ssshhhh oooo

[outro – Elara Harmony]
Fading echoes, gentle waves,
ooooo
iiiiii
Harmony, where the heart stays.]

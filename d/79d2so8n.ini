lyrics = [intro - distant echoes]
[male voice] Shadows in the night, they call  
[female voice] Whispered secrets, rise and fall  
ooooo  
iiiii

[verse 1 – City Pulse]  
Neon veins through concrete dreams  
Silent stories in the seams  
Tick-tock, the heartbeat of the streets  
Echoes of past, where future meets

[Chorus – Dramatic Horizon]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii

[Bridge - Neon Ghosts]  
Phantoms dance in electric haze  
Lost in time, in endless maze  
Ahhh shhhh  
[whispered echoes]

[outro - Fading Light]  
Distant echoes, fade away  
Night gives birth to a new day  
ooooo  
[final heartbeat]

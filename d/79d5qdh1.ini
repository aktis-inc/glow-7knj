[verse]
Pulse of the stars, we ignite,  
In a dance of colors, we take flight,  
Electric dreams, we're alive,  
In this cosmic groove, we thrive

[chorus]
wooooo  
Pulse with me, feel the beat,
iiiiiiii

[bridge]
Neon lights in the night,  
We are one, in this light,  
Energy flows, we unite

[drop]
ooooo  
Feel the creation's might  
aaaaa

[outro]
Dance till the morning light  
Pulse of creation, in the night

ooooo

[verse]
In neon glow, the city breathes  
A rhythm soft, like whispered dreams  
K-k-kavara's beat, a heart that sways  
Under stars, in moonlit rays

[chorus]
wooooooo  
Dance with me, in rain's embrace  
Every step, a pulse, a trace  

[bridge]
In shadows deep, we find our call  
A melody where echoes fall  
Heartbeats quicken, under skies  
Kavara groove, where silence flies

[outro]
ahhhhhhhh  
iiiiiiiii  
Fade into night, where dreams reside  
Kavara's song, our endless ride

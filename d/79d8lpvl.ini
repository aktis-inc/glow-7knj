whispering tides  
oooooo  
iiiiiii  
[verse 1]  
Softly, the world fades  
In hues of golden dreams  
We walk on sands of promises  
Where love's echo gleams  
[Pre-Chorus]  
oooooo  
Hand in hand, we drift  
Hearts like gentle waves  
In silent symphony  
[Chorus]  
woooahhh  
iiiiiiiii  
Our souls, like the sea  
Boundless and free  
[Bridge]  
In the quiet of the night  
Stars guide our flight  
Across the horizon, we soar  
[Outro - Fade]  
oooooo  
whispering tides

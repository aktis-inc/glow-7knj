[soft verse]
ooooo  
in the city, lights dance  
echoes of past and future  
iiiiii  

[build-up chorus]
shadows break, colors blend  
through the rhythm, we ascend  
oooo ooo aaaa  

[verse]
where the heart beats with the night  
fusion of dreams, in flight  
iiiiii  

[drop - cultural crossover]  
woooo iiii  

[outro - Yalor Vibes]

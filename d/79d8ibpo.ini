lyrics = [intro - Soft Strings]
ooooo  
[verse 1 - Gentle Whisper]  
In the echoes of past dreams  
We dance to silent tunes  
Love's gentle beams illuminate  
Our hearts like silver moons  
  
[Chorus - Harmonious Glow]  
iiiiii  
Eternal whispers, love's embrace  
Through time, we find our place  
ooooo  
  
[verse 2 - Tender Memories]  
Faint smiles in sepia hues  
A timeless love that never fades  
In the warmth of your gaze, I lose  
The shadows of forgotten days  
  
[bridge - Nostalgic Serenade]  
ahhh  
Together, we're a melody  
A song that time can't erase  
  
[outro - Fading Light]  
oooo love's gentle grace  
In echoes, our hearts embrace  
ahhhh

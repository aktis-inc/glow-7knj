lyrics = [intro - gentle waves]

[verse 1 – Island Whispers]
In the shadow of the palms, stories dance with the breeze
Echoes of old songs, in the language of the seas
ooooooohhhh

[Chorus – Harmonious Waves]
Under the stars, we sing, heart to heart
The island's voice, where past and present start

[Bridge - Cultural Flow]
Melodies entwined, in the tapestry of time
Flowing like the tides, timeless and sublime

[verse 2]
In the rhythm of the earth, our spirits find their way
Guided by the night, and the break of day
aaaaaaaaa

[outro - fading echoes]

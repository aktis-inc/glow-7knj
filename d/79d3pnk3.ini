lyrics = [intro - tranquil waves]
  
[soft verse]  
oooooo  
iiiiii

[verse 1 – Whispered Echoes]  
In the twilight glow, dreams unfold  
Gentle whispers, stories untold  
ooooo  
hhhhh

[Pre-Chorus - Serene Pulse]  
[soft tabla rhythm]  
Listen to the night, it calls  
In soft echoes, the heart falls

[Chorus - Dreamscape]  
wooooooo  
iiiiii  
Feel the calm, breathe it in  
The universe, where dreams begin

[Bridge - Sunset Hues]  
Colors blend, horizons meet  
In this moment, we find peace  
ahhhhh  
shhhhh

[verse 2 - Soft Serenity]  
In the silence, find your way  
Let the music guide and sway  
ooooo  
iiiiii

[outro - gentle fade]  
Soft echoes, drift away  
In Ilara's gentle sway]

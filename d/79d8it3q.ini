lyrics = [intro]
ooooo iiiii
  
[verse 1 – Neon Pulse]
Lights flicker, shadows play
In the city's endless ballet
We move like whispers in the dark
Chasing echoes, leaving our mark
zzzzzz

[Chorus – Electric Connection]
wooooooo  
iiiiiii  
In illusions we find our way
Through the night, we sway
  
[Bridge - Urban Rhythm] 
Together we're a symphony, unseen
A vibrant dance, an endless dream
Ahhhh oooooo
  
[verse 2]
Invisible threads bind us tight
In the glow of the city's light
We ride the rhythm, feel the beat
In this space, our souls meet

[outro - Fade to Light]
iiiiiiii  
shhhhhhh

lyrics = [intro beat]

[verse 1 â€“ Neon Glow]
In the fire's dance, echoes whisper
Every page a spark, every flame a song
Rhythms pulse, in the shadow's shimmer
Life ignites where the words belong
ooooooo

[Chorus â€“ Blaze Beat]
Flames of echoes, burning bright
In the night, we find our light
Dance through the fire, in the neon night
woooooo

[Bridge â€“ Echo Flow]
iiiiiiii
We rise in the glow, where stories unfold
Futures untold, in the flames we hold

[verse 2 â€“ Ember Pulse]
Ashes fall, but we remain
In the rhythm's call, we break the chain
Vibrant dreams in a world of rain
oooo aaa

[outro â€“ Fade to Light]
whispered echoes, fading bright
In the fire's dance, we find our flight

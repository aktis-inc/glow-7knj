[soft chant]
Ð°Ð°Ð°Ð°Ð°Ð°Ð°Ð°Ð°Ð°
oooooo

[mystic verse]
Sands of time, whispers of old
In the temple of the soul
Echoes of stories untold
Through the desert's gentle hold

[chime chorus]
iiiiiiiii

[meditative bridge]
Beneath the stars, where silence sings
The spirit soars on hidden wings
In the stillness, the heart finds peace
With every breath, the whispers cease

[outro - Twilight Glow]
oooooo

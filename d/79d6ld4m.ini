lyrics = [intro – Temple Dawn]
oooooo aaahh
Chanting whispers through the mist

[verse 1 – Sacred Call]
In the heart of the chant
Where the drums echo deep
Beneath the sacred sky
The spirits wake, no sleep
ooooo

[Chorus – Devotional Dance]
Bholenath, oh hear the call
Dance in the fire’s glow
Sacred rhythm in us all
Where the heartbeats flow
iiiii aaaa

[Bridge – Divine Echo]
Temple bells, they sing
Voices in the wind
In this moment, we are one
Where devotion begins
ssshhh aaaa

[outro – Eternal Harmony]
oooooo
In the rhythm, we find
The sacred, intertwined
Harmony, divine

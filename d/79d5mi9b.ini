lyrics = [intro]
mmmmmmm ooooooo

[verse - Mystic Path]
In the silence of the dawn  
Whispers of the heart awaken  
Guided by unseen hands  
Through the echoes of the soul

[chorus - Inner Light]
aaaaaah eeeeeee  
In the temple of the mind  
Harmony and peace entwine

[bridge - Sacred Journey]
Steps on the sand of time  
Carved in the wind's gentle rhyme  
oooo aaaa

[outro - Eternal Echo]
The spirit's song lingers on  
Carrying the light beyond

lyrics = [intro - gentle whispers]
ooooo aaahhh

[verse - Petal Drift]
Crimson petals float on dreams
In the night's soft embrace
Whispers carry through the breeze
Silent tales of grace

[chorus - Moonlit Whispers]
oooo aaaahhh
In the garden of the heart
Love's melody and art

[verse - Wind's Caress]
Softly spoken secrets sway
Echoes linger, fade away
In the realm of night-time's play

[bridge - Ethereal Glow]
iiiiii ooohhhh
Petals dance, softly glow
In the dreams where lovers go

[outro - Fading Echo]
ahhhhh ooooo
oooooo iiiiii

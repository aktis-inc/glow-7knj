oooo

[verse 1 – Urban Shadows]
In the night, echoes call my name
Every step, a dance in the rain
Neon signs, they flicker and play
Lost in the rhythm, we sway
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[Chorus – Electric Groove]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii

[Bridge - Moonlit Mystery] 
Shadows whisper, secrets untold
City lights, a story unfolds
Ahhhhhh shshshsh  
[echoed laughter]

[verse 2]
Through the streets, we chase the dream
Every corner, a new scheme
Under the stars, we find our way

[outro - Night's Embrace]
ooooo  
iiiiiiiii  
[fade]

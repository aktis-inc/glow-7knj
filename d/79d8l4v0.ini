lyrics = [intro - City Pulse]
(Street ambiance) oooooo  
(Street ambiance) aaaaaa

[verse 1 - Urban Dreams]  
In the city lights, stories unfold  
Every shadow whispers secrets untold  
Rrrrrraaaahhhhhh

[Chorus - Vibrant Streets]  
Dance with me, under the neon glow  
Feel the rhythm, let your spirit flow  
iiiiiiiii

[Bridge - Heartbeat of Life]  
City's breath, a timeless song  
Together we move, where we belong  
ooooo oooo

[verse 2 - Spirited Journey]  
Through the alleys, laughter rings  
In every corner, a new beginning  
aaaaaaahhh

[outro - City Reverie]  
As the sun sets, dreams take flight  
In this urban symphony, we unite  
zzzzzzzz]

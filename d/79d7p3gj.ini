lyrics = [intro - Ocean Waves]

[verse 1]
Echoes in the deep blue  
Where dreams and memories flow  
The sea holds stories untold  
In whispers soft and slow  
iiiiii ooooo 

[chorus - Whale Song]
Ancient tides, calling home  
In the rhythm of the waves  
Mysteries of the ocean  
In the song the whale saves  
ooooo iiiii 

[bridge - Flute's Whisper]
Gentle breeze over the sea  
Carrying tales from afar  
Strings and flutes in harmony  
Guide us under the stars  
aaaaaa iiiiiii 

[outro - Drift to Silence]
Waves fade into the night  
As the ocean sings its tune  
The world in quiet delight  
Beneath the silver moon  
oooo iiiii

[verse 1 – Time's Pulse]
Steps on ancient paths, whispers of tomorrow
Tradition's heart beats in a new dawn's glow

Destiny echoes, we follow its call
Boundless horizons, we rise from the fall

In the dance of stars, we find our song
Past and future, where we belong

[verse 2 – Journey's Flow]
Waves of sound, a river's endless stream
Dreams weave threads in a cosmic seam

oooooo
Echos of destiny, forever we'll sing
In the harmony of life, voices will ring

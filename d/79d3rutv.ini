lyrics = [intro - Quiet Dawn]
whispering breeze

[verse 1 – Gentle Embrace]  
A touch of light, in morning's grace  
Silent whispers, in a secret place  
ooooooo  
iiiiiiii  

[Chorus – Heart's Echo]  
In the stillness, hearts align  
Feel the rhythm, of time's design  
ooooo  

[Bridge - Sapphire Glow]  
Reflections dance, on water's skin  
Beneath the surface, dreams begin  
ahhhhhh  

[verse 2]  
Echoes linger, soft and clear  
In this moment, I feel you near  
zzzzzz  

[outro - Fading Light]  
soft whispers fade  
into the night  
iiiiiiii

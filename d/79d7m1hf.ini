wooooo

[verse - whispers of yesteryears]
In shadows of time, echoes call
Memories dance in twilight's fall
aahhhhhh

[bridge - soulful embrace]
oooooo
Past and present intertwine
Stories in silence, so divine

[chorus - nostalgic drift]
iiiiii
In the pulse of the heart, they remain
Whispered tales of joy and pain

[outro - fading echoes]
ooooo
In the gentle hold of night, they sing
Songs of old, on whispered wing

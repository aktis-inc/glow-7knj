lyrics = [intro - Gentle Rain]
oooooo  
iiiiiii  

[verse 1 - Whisper of the Past]  
Softly the rain speaks  
In echoes of forgotten dreams  
A path through time unfolds  
Memories woven in streams  

[Chorus - Monsoon's Embrace]  
oooooo  
Gentle whispers, tales untold  
In the rain's gentle hold  

[Bridge - Ethereal Flow]  
mmmmmm  
In the heart of the storm  
Stories are reborn  

[outro - Rain's Requiem]  
iiiiii  
ooooooo  
Embrace the rain, let it sing  
To the world, its offering

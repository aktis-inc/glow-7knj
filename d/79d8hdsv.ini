lyrics = [intro - City Pulse]

[verse 1]
Echoes in the night, city whispers   
Rhythms of the streets, shadows dance  
Dreams collide with neon glimmers  
Through the darkness, take a chance  
ooooo iiiiiii

[Pre-Chorus - Rising Tension]
shhhhhh  
In the echoes, feel the fire  
Burning brighter, climbing higher  

[Chorus - Bass Surge]  
woooooo  
Resonance, the city's call  
iiiiiiii

[Bridge - Urban Pulse]  
In the heart of the night, we find  
Pathways through the city kind  
Echoes follow, never blind  
Feel the rhythm, intertwined  
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[verse 2]
Through the alleyways, stories flow   
Bassline guides where we should go  
Echoes linger, ebb and flow  
Ride the currents, let it show  

[glitch build-up]  
ssshhhh oooo  

[distorted whisper] Feel the resonance… (oo-yeah!)

[outro - Echoes Fade]"]

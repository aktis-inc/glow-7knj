[verse]
In the maze of lights  
We chase the night  
Excess is our game  
We play with no shame  

[pre-chorus]
oooooo  
Too much is never enough  
We revel in the rush  

[chorus]
Labyrinth of excess  
Where dreams confess  
oooooo  
Dance through the mess  

[bridge]
Zzzzzz  
Neon glow, let it show  
Echos in the shadow  
ssssss

[outro]
ooooo  
Fade into the night  
Labyrinth of light

lyrics = [intro - Celestial Echo]
Ahhhhhh  
Ooooooo  

[verse 1 - Heart's Whisper]
In the silence of the stars  
I found your gaze, my compass  
Through the night, our souls dance  
In a cosmic, endless trance  
oooooo

[Chorus - Celestial Embrace]  
You and I, in orbits of the heart  
Spinning close, never apart  
In this universe, we ignite  
With a love that's infinite  
Ahhhhhh

[Bridge - Cosmic Pulse] 
Guitar strums  
Soft percussion  
Breathe in the universe  
Ahhhh ooooh

[outro - Galactic Fade]  
Our love, a stellar light  
Guiding through the night  
Forever in celestial flight  
Ooooooo

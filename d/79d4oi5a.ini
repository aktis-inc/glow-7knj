oooooo aaaaaa

[verse 1]
Sunlight paints the dusty road
Feet start moving on their own
Old stories hum in the air
Heart beats faster, light and free
iiiiiiiiii

[Pre-Chorus - Suspenseful]
Something's rising, a joyful wave
Can't hold back, no time to save
aaaaaaa iiiii

[Chorus - Explosion of color]
Bloom! Bloom! Every step a fire
Higher! Higher! Fueling my desire
Rhythms echoing through the night
Spinning shadows in the fading light
oooooo aaaaaa

[instrumental break - tumbi lead]

[verse 2]
Fields are gold beneath the sun
Every worry simply gone
Hands clap loud, a steady beat
Dancing makes the moment sweet

[Pre-Chorus - Suspenseful]
Something's rising, a joyful wave
Can't hold back, no time to save
aaaaaaa iiiii

[Chorus - Explosion of color]
Bloom! Bloom! Every step a fire
Higher! Higher! Fueling my desire
Rhythms echoing through the night
Spinning shadows in the fading light
oooooo aaaaaa

[Drop - Final Descent]
[echoing growl] zzzzzhhhhhh boom

[outro - fade with dholak]

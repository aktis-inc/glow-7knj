lyrics = [intro rhythm]

[verse 1 – Joyful Stride]
In a city full of dreams
Laughter echoes through the seams
Every corner holds a tale  
Adventure sets the sail

[chorus – Vibrant Pulse]  
ooooo
Dance with the rhythm
Feel the freedom call
iiiiii

[verse 2 – Urban Beat]
Steps align with city lights
Colors blend in endless nights
Voices rise, a joyful choir
Hearts ablaze with desire

[bridge - Playful Interlude] 
ooooo aaahhh  
Feel the world spin around
Life’s a dance on this ground

[outro - Sunset Glow]
[soft echo]  
ooooo  
Let the echoes stay  
In the heart of the day

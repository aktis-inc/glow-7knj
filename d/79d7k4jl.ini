lyrics = [intro - Whisper of Strings]
(Soft harmonium)  
ooooooooooooo  
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii  
[verse 1 – Echoes of the Past]  
The air whispers tales of yesteryears  
In every note, a memory reappears  
zzzhhhh  
[Chorus – Timeless Love]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii  
Love dances in twilight's glow  
Hearts sway to a gentle flow  
[Bridge - Harmonious Dream]  
Their song, a soft embrace  
A timeless serenade in grace  
Ahhhhhh  
[verse 2]  
Stars align in the melody's call  
Two souls entwined, they fall  
[glitch build-up]  
ssshhhh oooo  
[Outro - Fade into Memory]

lyrics = [intro - Desert Echoes]
ooohhhh  
iiiiiiiiii

[verse]  
In the sands, stories weave  
Through the skies, dreams believe  
ooooohhh  
gentle whispers call

[chorus - Twilight Dance]  
ooooo  
iiiii  
Dance with the dust, under the moon  
Stars sing the ancient tune

[bridge - Eternal Sands]  
Time flows, ever gentle  
Heartbeats echo, elemental  
ahhhh  
oooooo

[outro - Fading Light]  
Shadows grow, yet hearts glow  
Desert's song, softly flows  
ooooo  
iiiiiiiii

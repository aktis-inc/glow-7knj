[verse]
V dedine ticho šumí les
Vánok nesie staré piesne
Čas tu plynie, kým sa svet mení
Zostáva len ozvena v tieni

[chorus - harmonious echo]
ooooo
iiiiii

[bridge - cultural dance]
Harmonika znie, srdcia bijú
Dávne príbehy sa v piesni skrýjú
Ššššš

[outro - gentle fade]
V ozvenách času, náš svet žije ďalej

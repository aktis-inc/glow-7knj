whispering breeze

[verse]
In gentle whispers, love's song flows
Through fields of dreams, where wildflowers grow
oooooo

[chorus]
Urvi, in harmony, hearts align
Melody of stars, softly intertwine
iiiiiiii

[bridge]
Eternal echoes, in moonlit skies
A dance of souls, where silence lies
ahhhhh

[outro]
Harmony fades, into the night
Love's gentle glow, soft twilight

lyrics = [intro roar]

[verse 1]
Tires burn on the asphalt
Echoes in the night
Chasing shadows of the past

[chorus]
Zzzzzzzzz  
ooooo  
Riding through the storm

[verse 2]
Engines scream, hearts ignite
Freedom calls with every mile
Beyond the limits of the mind

[bridge]
Doors open to the unknown  
iiiiiiiiiiiii  
Vast horizons calling

[outro]
Ride with the wind  
oooooo  
Fade into the dawn

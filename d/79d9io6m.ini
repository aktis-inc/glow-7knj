lyrics = [intro - city pulse]
woooooo  
[verse - Rhythmic Echoes]
In the streets where dreams collide  
Footsteps echo, side by side  
ooooo

[Pre-Chorus - Rising Tide]  
We move like waves in the night  
Chasing stars, feeling the light

[Chorus - Fortune's Embrace]  
Woooooo  
Dance through the shadows  
With dreams we borrow  
oooooo

[Bridge - Electric Horizon]  
Hearts in sync, the night ignites  
Underneath the vibrant lights  
Ahhhh shhhh

[outro - fade to dawn]
iiiiiiiiiii

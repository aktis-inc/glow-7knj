[verse]
ooooo
Sitar echoes in the desert breeze
Tabla rhythms guide our feet
Dhols call the gathering
In celebration, we meet  
iiiiii

[chorus - Festival Pulse]
Aaaaaa
Colors swirl in joyous dance
Arnav melodies in our heart
Strings and beats in harmony
Tradition and joy, they start

[bridge - Cultural Flow]
Voices rise, a tapestry of sound
Ancient tales in every note found
oooooo

[outro - Rhythmic Farewell]
iiiiiiii
As the sun sets, music lingers
A journey of sound, through time we wander
Arnav whispers, a melody remembered

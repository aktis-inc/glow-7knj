oooooo

[verse 1 – Lightning Pulse]  
In the storm's embrace, we rise  
Electric dreams, neon skies  
iiiiiii  

[chorus – Thunder Dance]  
(Chanting) Feel the power, feel the light  
oooo  
Underneath the electric night  

[bridge - Digital Echoes]  
whispers in the rain, echoes in the mind  
aaaaa  
iiiiiii

[verse 2 – Neon Voyage]  
Follow the current, ride the sound  
Pulsing rhythm, we are unbound  
zzzzzzhhh

[outro - Storm's End]  
ooooo  
Fade into the night, with dreams alight  
iiiiii

lyrics = [intro - Whispered Breeze]
(soft humming)  
mmmmmmmmm  
iiiiiiiiii  

[verse 1 – Heart's Echo]  
In the silence, our hearts converse  
Gentle whispers, the universe  
Softest touch, our souls align  
In this moment, love entwines  
mmmmmmmm  

[Chorus – Moonlit Serenade]  
oooooo  
Silent whispers of the heart  
Guide us through the night's art  
iiiiiiiiiiii

[Bridge - Dreamscape]  
Floating through the starlit sky  
Together, you and I  
ahhhhhhhhhh  

[verse 2 – Eternal Harmony]  
With each note, we find our way  
In the music, we choose to stay  
Dreamlike dance, a tender sway  
Forever in this love's ballet  
mmmmmmm ooooooo  

[outro - Fading Glow]  
(soft humming fades)  
iiiiii mmmmm  
ooooooooo

[verse]
In the depths, echoes play
Mysteries unfold within the sway
oooooo iiiiiii

[chorus]
Whale songs calling, deep and wide
Ride the waves, let go of pride
aaaaaa ooooooo

Silhouettes in the moonlit sea
A dance of shadows, wild and free
shhhhh iiiiiii

[outro]
Ride the tide, let it be
The ocean's heart, wild and free

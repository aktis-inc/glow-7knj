[verse 1]
ooooo  
Starlight whispers, beyond known skies  
iiiiiiii  
A journey through time, where dreams arise

[build-up]
ooooo  
Cosmic echoes, in the silent night  
shhhhhh

[chorus]  
Beyond the stars, our fate aligns  
woooooooo  
iiiiiiiii  
In the dance of the infinite, we find

[bridge - Celestial Drift]
Stars collide, in cosmic grace  
Their light a guide, through endless space  
ahhhhhh

[outro - Cosmic Fade]
oooooo  
In silence, we drift, beyond the known  
shhhhh  
Into the cosmic, where dreams are sown  
[soft echo]

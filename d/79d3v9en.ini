oooooo  
iiiiiiii

[verse 1 - Vibrant Pulse]  
Guitars sing, hearts align  
Every glance, a soft sign  
In the night, echoes play  
Dance with me, in this sway  
ahhhhhh

[Chorus - Passion's Call]  
wooooooo  
Feel the fire, in the sound  
Lost in moments, we are bound  
iiiiiiiyyy  
oooooo

[Bridge - Soulful Tide]  
Trumpet cries, gentle sighs  
In the moon's embrace, we rise  
shhhhhhh

[verse 2 - Heart's Echo]  
Days of old, whispers told  
In this dance, stories unfold  
Galor's song, timeless grace  
In your eyes, I find my place  
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[Outro - Fading Light]  
oooooo  
Galor's echo, softly ends  
In the night, where time bends  
iiiiiiiii]

ohhh oooooo
eerie synth echoes

Kaleidoscope dreams unfold
In the city's neon glow
Rhythms pulse and take control
Wild beats make the city flow

Bass thumps, colors collide

Lost in the jungle of sound
Adrenaline rushes like a storm
Every beat a wild rebound
In this vibrant, electric form

Festival lights, endless sound

[outro]

oooooo

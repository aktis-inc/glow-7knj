lyrics = [intro - flickering sparks]

[verse - Desert Mirage]
Dusty winds carry whispers
Through the ancient streets
We dance in shadows, unseen
Heartbeats echo in the heat

[chorus - Ignition]
Fires blaze in the night sky
ooooo  
iiiiiiii  
Rhythms pulse, we ignite

[bridge - Ember's Edge]
Lost in vibrant melodies
A world where dreams collide
Burning bright, we rise

[outro - Ashes to Light]
From the ashes, we ascend
ooooo  
iiiiiiii  
A new dawn, our story penned

lyrics = [intro - Bamboo Whisper]

[verse - Flowing Stream]
Soft winds carry tales untold  
In shadows where the bamboo sways  
Mysteries unfold, silently bold  
oooo

[Pre-Chorus - Rising Mist]  
[soft chime]
aahhhh  
Voices weave through moonlit trees  
Echoes dance on the breeze

[Chorus - Digital Harmony]  
iiiiiiii  
Bamboo secrets, ancient night  
Whispers blend in digital light  
zzzzzz

[Bridge - Timeless Echo]  
Beneath the stars, where legends dwell  
Time's embrace, a gentle spell  
ahhhh shhhhh

[outro - Fade to Silence]

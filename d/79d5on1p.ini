lyrics = [intro - whispering echoes]
(soft harmonies) Eclipsed in shadows  
(soft harmonies) A gentle heart's sigh  
ooooooo  
iiiiiiiiiiiiii

[verse 1 – Celestial Hues]  
A breeze stirs the silent dawn  
Stars paint the sky’s canvas  
In dreams, we find solace  
Eternal whispers call

[Pre-Chorus – Ethereal Flow]  
[soft rise]  
ooooo  
In the heart's embrace, we soar  
Through veils of time, we glide

[Chorus – Cosmic Embrace]  
woooooo  
iiiiiiiayyyyyy

[Bridge - Infinite Drift]  
In the quiet, we are bound (ah!)  
By the light, we are found (yes!)  
Ahhhhhh mmmm  
[echoed breath]

[verse 2 – Whispered Paths]  
Through the night, our paths entwine  
Guided by the lunar glow  
In the silent space, we find  
A peace that never fades

[gentle drop]  
ssshhhh oooo  

[soft whisper] we are the echoes… (oo-yeah!)

[outro - Twilight Fade]

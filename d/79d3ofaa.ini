[verse – Zephyr's Call]
Rhythm flows like river's song
Saxophone sings, spirits rise
Echos of the past, future's dance
oooo aaaahhh

[Chorus – Wakafrika Spirit]
Djembe calls, voices unite
Harmony of earth and sky
Wakafrika's heart beats strong
wooooo iiiii

[Bridge – Continental Dance]
In the wind, stories unfold
Steps of time, vibrant and bold
Zephyr carries tales untold
ahhhhhh oooooo

[Outro – Journey's End]
Dance the path, join the sound
In the breeze, freedom's found
Zephyr's touch, world unbound
iiiiiii oooooo

[outro sax]

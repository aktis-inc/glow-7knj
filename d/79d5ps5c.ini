crackle crackle  
oooooooh

[verse 1 – Ember's Call]
In the heart of fiery dreams  
Whispers weave through ancient streams

Burning bright, the echoes fly  
Through the night, the spirits cry

Hear the call of ancient lore  
In the dance of fire's core  
ahhhhhhh

[outro – Fade to Ash]
soft embers glow  
iiiiii aaaaaaa  
fading to silence

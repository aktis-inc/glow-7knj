lyrics = [intro rhythm]

[verse 1 – Flicker of Light]  
In the city of sounds,  
Where shadows leap and bound,  
Every step a heartbeat,  
Every glance a spark.  

[chorus – Dance of the Night]  
ooooo  
Dance in the shadows,  
Feel the rhythms flow,  
Underneath the starlit glow,  
We find the night unfold.  
iiiiii

[bridge – Echoes of Tradition]  
Hear the call of ancient drums,  
Melding with the city's hum,  
We are the echoes of the past,  
In the future's dance we cast.  

[drop – Pulse and Light]  
wooooo  
ooooo

[outro – Fade into Dawn]  
As night fades to day,  
Our dance lights the way,  
In the shadows, we remain,  
A memory of the night’s refrain.  
ssshhhh oooo

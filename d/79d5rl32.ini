[verse 1 – Moor's Echoes]
Yıldızlar altında dans ederiz  
Rüzgarla gelen eski hikayeler  
Kahkahalarla dolu bir gece  
Kalpler çarpıyor, ritimle

[Chorus – Festival Fire]  
oooo  
iiiiii  
Eller yukarı, aşk ve neşe  
Gözlerimizde parlayan ışıklar

[Bridge - Spirit's Dance]  
aaaa  
Ruhumuzda yankılanan ezgiler  
Yeniden doğar her adımda

[outro - Joyful Fade]

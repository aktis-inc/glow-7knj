oooooooo  
ssshhhh

[verse – Under the Banyan]
Beneath the sprawling canopy  
Dreams take flight in gentle sighs  
Through ancient roots, the stories weave  
A world unfolds beneath our eyes  
shhhhhhh

[Chorus – Ethereal Echo]  
ooooooo  
iiiiiiii  
In the stillness of the night  
We find our way, our guiding light  

[Bridge – Serenity Path]
Softly tread the path of dreams  
Where time is lost, and all redeems  
ahhhhhhh oooooo

[outro – Dream's Embrace]
iiiii ooooo  
In whispers, the journey ends  
Yet in our hearts, it begins again

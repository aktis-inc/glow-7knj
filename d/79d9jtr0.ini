lyrics = [intro - City Pulse]
(wind howl) iiiiiiiiiiii

[verse 1 - Echoes]
Concrete dreams beneath the sky  
Whispers of the past, shadows fly  
The city speaks in silent tongues  
Where every soul belongs

[Chorus - Soul's Reflection]
oooooo (soulful echo)  
In the heart of the night  
We find our light

[verse 2 - Street Symphony]
Stories etched on every wall  
In the neon glow, we stand tall  
Footsteps echo in the rain  
In the rhythm of the pain

[bridge - Urban Lament]
ahhhhhhh  
Where dreams and reality collide  
In the city's embrace, we confide

[outro - Twilight Fade]
(fading sirens)  
We rise, we fall, we echo on  
In the streets where we belong  
ooooo iiiiiii

[verse 1 - Embrace of Echoes]
In the heart of whispers, we find our song  
Timeless paths that carry us along  
oooooo

[chorus - Dance of Memories]
Together in the light of yesterday  
Our voices blend, never to fade away  
iiiiii

[bridge - Harmonious Crescendo]
We rise on dreams woven in stars  
Guided by echoes from afar  
aaaaah

[outro - Eternal Fade]
As the city breathes, we drift in time  
A duet of souls, forever in rhyme  
oooo aaaa iiii]

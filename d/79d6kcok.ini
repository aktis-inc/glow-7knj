lyrics = [intro - Soft Whisper]
shhhhhh oooohhh  
gentle breeze  
whispers of time...

[verse - Forest Echoes]  
In the quiet dawn,  
memories unfold,  
echoes of yesterday,  
stories untold...

[chorus - Sunlit Dreams]  
oooooooh  
breezes carry  
the songs of the past,  
iiiiii  
gentle and vast...

[bridge - Misty Reflections]  
shadows dance,  
in the morning light,  
soft and bright,  
a fleeting sight...

[outro - Fading Glimmers]  
oooooo  
into the mist,  
we drift away,  
fading echoes,  
end of day...

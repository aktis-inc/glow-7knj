lyrics = [intro - desert whispers]
woooo oooh ayyyyyy

[verse - Oasis Dream]  
In the sands, stories unfold  
Under the moon's gentle gaze  
Voices of the past linger  
Echoes of life, a timeless maze  
iiiiiiii ooooo  

[chorus - Harmony's Call]  
Qiira's echo, a vibrant song  
In every rhythm, we belong  
Soulful notes, a dance of hearts  
Together, never apart  
ooooo iiiiii

[bridge - Melodic Journey]  
Across the dunes, whispers soar  
Traditions blend, forevermore  
With each beat, a life anew  
In the night, dreams come through  
ahhhhhh ooooo

[outro - Starry Fade]  
Under stars, silence falls  
Qiira's echo, a gentle call  
oooooo iiiiii aaaa

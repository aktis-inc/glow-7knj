lyrics = [intro - Soft Awakening]
ahhhhhh  

[verse 1 - Light's Embrace]  
Gentle rays of morning  
Whisper through the dawn  
Harmony in silence  
A new day is born  

[chorus - Zyrah's Light]  
ooooo ooooo  
Light of Zyrah, guiding through  
Hearts unite in a glow so true  

[bridge - Ethereal Passage]  
Beneath the vast sky  
Dreams take their flight  
In the embrace of light  
All is serene, all is right  

[verse 2 - Melodies of Peace]  
Echoes of tradition  
In every gentle breeze  
A symphony of unity  
In moments like these  

[outro - Serenity's Call]  
ahhhh ahhhh  
Peaceful light, eternal call  
In Zyrah's glow, we find it all

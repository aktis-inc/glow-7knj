lyrics = [intro build-up]

[verse]
pulsing lights, we move as one
underneath the neon sun
wooooooo
iiiiiiiiiiii

[chorus]
oooo ooooo
feel the bass, let it run
dance 'til the night is done

[bridge]
heartbeat syncs, with every beat
in this rhythm, we find our feet
zzzzzzhhhhh

[outro - fade]
ooooooo
night whispers, sweet retreat
as we leave, echoes repeat

lyrics = [intro - playful phone ring]

[verse 1]
In the static, whispers play
Voices dance, a game of sway
Hearts beat, a secret crush
Words in jest, a playful hush
oooooohhhh iiiii

[chorus - mischievous tease]
Laughter echoes through the line
In this city, we intertwine
Hey, hey, it's a game we play
Caught in whispers, night and day

[verse 2]
Neon lights and shadows blend
Jokes and tales, we twist and bend
Through the wires, we send our cheer
In this world, we disappear

[bridge - teasing exchange]
He said, she said, a playful jest
In this dance, we are the best
ooooo eee aaa

[outro - fading laughter]
Whispers fade, night's embrace
In the static, find our place
Hey, hey, hear the laughter's call
In the city, we stand tall

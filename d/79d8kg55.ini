[verse 1 - Horizon's Call]
Across the waves, the whispers fly  
A tale of lands where dreams reside  
Vibrant hues and endless skies  
A world where hearts can never hide  
oooooo iiiiiiii

[Chorus - Island Dance]
Dance with the sun, under the moon  
Feel the rhythm, the joyous tune  
oooooo

[Bridge - Echoes of the Sea]
Echos call from distant shores  
In every wave, a story pours  
ssssshhhhhh  
ooooooo

[verse 2 - Hidden Tales]
In shadows deep, the secrets lie  
Unveiling dreams that never die  
A tapestry of light and sound  
In every beat, the world is found  
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[outro - Whispers Fade]
Fade to the horizon's edge  
Where tales of old and new are wed  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii]

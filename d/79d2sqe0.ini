ooooo 

[verse 1 – Blossoms]  
Soft petals fall, whispers of the heart  
In the moonlit garden, love's gentle start  
iiiiiii  

[chorus – Eternal Echo]  
ooooo  
Hearts unite, timeless embrace  
In the glow of stars, find our place  

[bridge – Dreamscape]  
Under the starlit canopy, we dance  
In the rhythm of love, a timeless trance  

[verse 2]  
Memories woven in the night air  
In Fiora's whisper, love’s tender care  
oooo  

[outro – Moonlit Serenade]  
Softly, softly, dreams take flight  
In the arms of night, love's gentle light  
aaaa oooo]

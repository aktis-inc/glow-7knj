[verse 1 – Mountain Echoes]
En las sombras de los Andes
Un canto llama a despertar
Ríos de fuego en mis venas
Susurros que nunca se van
ooooo iiiiiii

[Chorus – Summit's Call]
Aaaaahhhhhh
Libertad nos encontrará
A lo lejos del cielo azul
Woooooo

[Bridge – Andean Dreams]
Guitarras que lloran mi verdad
Voces que no pueden callar
Ooohhhh

[outro – Freedom's Embrace]
Ahhhh aaaaa
Ecos que nunca se irán
Libertad nos encontrará
iiiiiiii oooooo

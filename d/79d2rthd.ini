[verse 1 - Echoes of Tradition]
In the rhythm of the earth,
Voices rise, calling the stars,
oooooo oooooo

[chorus - Dance of Souls]
iiiiiiiiiiiii  
In the heart, a melody flows,
Raga, the soul never knows,
oooooo

[bridge - Celestial Connection]
iiiiiiiiiiii  
Through the night, our spirits soar,
Songs of old, forevermore,
ahhhhhh

[outro - Reverie Fade]
Shadows dance with the light,
In the raga, we find flight,
eeeeee

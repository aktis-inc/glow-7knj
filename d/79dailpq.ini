lyrics = [intro]

[gentle strings]

[verse]  
Di bawah sinar bulan  
Kenangan datang berbisik  
oooohhhh...  
Di setiap langkahku

[chorus]  
Rindu yang tak terucap  
Mengalun dalam alunan  
iiiiii...  
Menggapai masa lalu

[bridge]  
Lembut suara hati  
Menghantar kita kembali  
ooooo...  
Ke pelukan kenangan

[outro]  
Menghilang dalam irama  
ooooo...  
Kenangan yang abadi

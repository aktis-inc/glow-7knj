oooooo

[verse – Skyward]
In the dawn, wings gleam
Silent whispers of the sea
Above the world, dreams stream
Endless horizons set me free
aaaaaa

[chorus – Celestial Flight]
iiiiii
Sailing through the morning light
Boundless as the sky at night
ooooooo

[bridge – Soaring Spirit]
Higher, higher, beyond the blue
Dreams unfurl, forever new
shhhhhh

[outro – Distant Echo]
ooooo iiiiii
Fading into the endless sky
The journey's song, a gentle sigh

lyrics = [intro - Whispering Mist]

[verse 1 - Echoes]
Soft steps in the haze
Silent whispers call
Through the misty maze
Lost in it all
oooooo iiiii

[chorus - Serene Light]
Glimmers in the night
Voices in the mist
Guiding gentle flight
In dreams we exist
aaaaaa

[bridge - Reflective Calm]
Time stands still, we listen
To the echoes of our past
In the quiet, they glisten
Memories that last
ssshhh iiiii

[outro - Fading Echoes]
Drift away, drift away
In the mist, we sway
oooooo

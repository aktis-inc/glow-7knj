lyrics = [intro]

[verse]
Swaying shadows, echoes in time
Beats of old, rhythms align
ooooo

[chorus]
Dance in the twilight, spirits in flight
Ancient whispers, guiding the night
iiiiii

[bridge]
Colors collide, worlds entwine
In the shadows, we find the sign
ooooo

[outro]
Rhythms fade, shadows remain
In the dance, we break the chain

ooooooo

Voices rise, hearts align  
In the dance of time, we find  
Mystic echoes, bold and bright  
Guiding souls into the night

ooooo  
Jubilation, celebration  
iiiiiiiii

Harmony unfolds, spirits blend  
In this song, we transcend  
Hands clap, feet move  
Life's melody, a joyous groove

oooooo  
(soft fade)  
iiiiiiiiiii  
Celebration's end, but echoes remain

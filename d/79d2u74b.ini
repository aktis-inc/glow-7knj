(gentle piano)  
wwwwww  
(whispered harmonies)  
iiiiiii  
[verse 1 - Heart's Call]  
Beneath the twilight's gentle hold  
Two souls dance, a story told  
ooooooo  
[Pre-Chorus - Echoed Promise]  
Soft whispers in the evening air  
Hearts align with tender care  
[Chorus - Virela's Embrace]  
wwwaaah  
In love's embrace, we find our way  
Through shadows cast, and light's display  
[Bridge - Eternal Bond]  
Hand in hand, we'll face the dawn  
Our love, a path forever drawn  
[verse 2 - Fading Light]  
The sun dips low, colors blend  
A love like ours will never end  
[glitch build-up]  
ooooo  
[Outro - Gentle Fade]  
(soft echoes)  
iiiiii  
Forevermore, in Virela's grace

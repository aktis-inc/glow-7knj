oooo aaaaa 

[verse 1 - Rhythmic Journey]  
In circles we dance,  
Threads of time unwound,  
Voices rise, ancient sound,  
Beneath the Ethiopian sun.

[chorus - Vibrant Soul]  
Eeeeyyyoooo  
Feel the heartbeat, life has begun,  
iiiiiiii  

[bridge - Tapestry of Whispers]  
Colorful dreams unfold,  
In stories never told,  
We sing, we soar,  
Through open doors.

[outro - Harmonious Fade]  
aaaaa ooooo  
In whispers, we find home.

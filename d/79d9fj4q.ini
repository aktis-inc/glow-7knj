lyrics = [intro glitch]
Flicker and fade  
Burn through the night  

[verse 1]  
In the ashes of thoughts  
A spark ignites  
Whispers in the neon glow  
Illuminate the fight  

[Pre-Chorus]  
oooooooooo  
Truth in embers  
Secrets in the smoke  

[Chorus]  
iiiiiiiiii  
Through the flames, we see  
oooo aaa  
Perception set free  

[Bridge]  
Digital echoes  
In a world of light  
We dance through the fire  
In this endless night  

[outro]  
Fading whispers  
Embrace the glow  
In the flicker  
Let go

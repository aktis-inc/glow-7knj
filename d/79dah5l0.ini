lyrics = [intro - Soft Waves]
wooooooo  
iiiiiiii

[verse 1 - Shifting Sands]
Colors merge, horizons fade
In this dreamscape, we cascade
Silent whispers, echo through
Lost in visions, old and new

[Chorus - Kaleidoscope]
oooooo  
oooooo  
Spinning light, kaleidoscope dreams
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Where the night and day convene  
wooooooo

[Bridge - Ethereal Drift]
Floating in an endless sea
Time's a loop, sets us free
shhhhhhhh

[verse 2 - Reflections]
Mirrors dance, shadows play
In this trance, we'll always stay
Deep within, where secrets lie
In the clouds, we touch the sky

[outro - Dream Fade]
oooooo  
iiiiiiii  
toooooo  
oooooooo

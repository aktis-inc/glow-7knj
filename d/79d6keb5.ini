Echoes rise
Whispering winds
oooooo

[verse 1 – Electric Whispers]
In the night, shadows dance
Hearts collide, a fleeting trance
iiiiii

[build-up – Rhythmic Echo]
ooooo
Feel the beat, lose control
In this moment, we're whole

[chorus – Neon Surge]
wooooooo  
oooooo

[bridge – Moors Melody]
Lost in time, we roam
Through the echoes, find our home

[outro – Wind's Caress]
Softly fading away
Whispers on the wind

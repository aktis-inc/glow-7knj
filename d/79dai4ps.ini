lyrics = [intro - vibrant pulse]

[verse 1]
In the shadows, we find our light
With every step, we take flight
Dancing in the echoes of the night
ooooo iiiii

[chorus]
Rising shadows, dancing lights
Feel the heartbeat, take the heights
aaaaa iiiii

[bridge - rhythmic surge]
Steps of tradition, steps of new
In harmony, we break through

[verse 2]
Strings and drums weave the tale
In this dance, we’ll never fail
oooo iiiii

[outro - radiant glow]
Together we rise, shadows and lights
In this dance, we find our sights

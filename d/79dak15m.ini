[verse - Neon Dreams]
oooo  
In the forgotten echoes  
Where islands float and cascade  
Whispers paint the night

[build-up - Pulsar]
shhhhhh  
Vibrations of solitude  
Dance beneath the neon glow

[chorus - Electric Heartbeat]
ooooo  
iiiiii  
In the rhythm of the unknown  
We find our light

[bridge - Cosmic Drift]
Floating through the ether  
With whispers of the past  
The future calls in echoes

[outro - Fade to Neon]

[verse - Echo of Thoughts]
Time whispers secrets softly
In the hush of distant dreams
Floating through the sky's embrace
Where silence sings its themes

[piano interlude]

[Chorus - Winds of Change]
ooooo
iiiiii
Through time's embrace, we wander
Boundless skies, hearts ponder

[Bridge - Whispers of the Past]
Gentle echoes, fleeting shadows
Lost in moments, we follow

[outro - fading echoes]

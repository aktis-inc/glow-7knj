[verse 1 - Urban Pulse]  
Beats of the street, pulse of the heart  
Echoes of the past, in neon art

Bold and bright, the dhol resounds  
In the city's light, tradition rebounds

Ancient rhythms, future's call  
In every note, we stand tall  
shhhhh ooooo

History and now, together they weave  
In Xylar's groove, we believe

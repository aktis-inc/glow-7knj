lyrics = [intro beat]
(whispered echoes) In the city glow
(whispered echoes) Where the shadows flow
oooooo  
iiiiiiii

[verse 1 – Neon Pulse]
Under neon skies, where the echoes play
Rhythms clash, in the night's display
Voices whisper, in the urban maze
I'm the guide, in this electric blaze
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[Pre-Chorus – Rhythm's Edge]  
[soft glitch]
oooooooooo
Through the noise, a path unfurls
Beats collide, like planets swirl

[Chorus – Orion's Groove]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii

[Bridge - Cosmic Flow] 
Lost in time, in the city's hum (groove!)
Path unknown, but the beat is home (yeah!)
Ahhh shshshsh  
[echoed breath]

[verse 2]
Chasing lights, on a winding road
Every step, a story told
Alive in sound, bold yet untold

[glitch build-up]  
ssshhhh oooo  

[distorted whisper] groove... pulse... transcend... (oo-yeah!)

[outro - Orion Groove]

lyrics = [intro – Ocean's Whisper]
(soft echo) ooooo

[verse 1 – Tides of Time]  
In the quiet waves, stories unfold  
Each ripple a memory, silent and bold

[chorus – Solace Sea]  
woooo  
iiiiii  
In this embrace, we find our place  
No white flag, just ocean's grace

[bridge – Reflections]  
Softly drifting, time suspends  
Oceans whisper, never ends  
ahhhhhhh

[outro – Gentle Fade]  
ooooo  
Through the calm, we belong  
Soft echoes of a timeless song

lyrics = [intro - Whisper of Night]
oooooo  
shhhhh

[verse 1]  
In shadows, we find our truths  
Silent echoes of the past  
Dreams that dance, softly entwined  
In the moon's gentle cast  
oooooo

[chorus - Reflection's Dance]  
oooo  
We move with the night  
Our steps, a silent vow  
In the glow of starlight  
We dance with shadows now  
iiiii

[bridge - Echoes in the Dark]  
shhhh  
Soft whispers call our names  
A journey through the night  
In shadows, we remain  
Dancing till morning light  
ahhhh

[outro - Fading Light]  
oooo  
shhhh  
In the quiet, we rest  
Till shadows dance again  
ooooo

ooooo iiiii

[verse 1 – City Pulse]  
Under neon skies, echoes dance  
Through streets of dreams, shadows play  
Whispering tales of forgotten stars  
In Haloir's embrace, we sway  
zzzzhhh  

[Pre-Chorus – Electric Drift]  
[soft glitch]  
oooooo iiiiiii  
In the heartbeats of night  
We find our flight  

[Chorus – Cosmic Serenade]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiiiii  

[Bridge – Twilight Reflections]  
In the pulse of the city, we are alive  
Vibrant lights and echoes collide  
Ahhhhhh shhhhhhhh  
[whispered echoes]

[verse 2]  
Through the veil of the night  
We chase the dreams that ignite  
Beyond the horizon, we soar  

[glitch build-up]  
ssshhhh oooo  

[outro - Haloir Echoes]

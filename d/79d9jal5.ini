lyrics = [intro - Whispered Echoes]
(softly) ooooh... iiiii

[verse 1 - Dream's Lament]  
In shadows deep, we wander  
Through echoes of forgotten days  
Our dreams, they softly falter  
In a maze of endless haze  
oooooo

[chorus - Timeless Yearning]  
We chase the fading whispers  
Of a love beyond the night  
Our hearts, they beat in silence  
Yearning for that distant light  
iiiiiiii

[bridge - Echo's Call]  
Through twisted paths, we follow  
The echoes of our past  
In dreams, we find our solace  
And hope that it will last  
ahhhhh

[outro - Fading Reverie]  
(whispered) oooooo  
iiiiii  
(softly) fade away...

lyrics = [intro - Whispering Time]
oooooo iiiiiii aaaaaa  
[soft rain patter]

[verse 1 - Dream's Edge]
In Ithara's light, we dance  
Memories like soft rain  
Threads of time intertwine  
Silent echoes call our names  
ssshhhhh oooo

[Pre-Chorus - Gentle Cascade]  
ooooo iii
In the heart's quiet embrace  
Moments drift, gently traced

[Chorus - Reverie Flow]  
woooooo  
iiiiiiii

[Bridge - Echoing Silhouettes] 
In shadows, we find our way  
Dreams unfold, night turns to day  
ahhhhh shhhhhhh

[verse 2]
In the wind, whispers of old  
Stories told, dreams unfold  
Eternal paths, softly paved

[glitch build-up]  
ssshhhh oooo  

[outro - Ithara Reverie]
iiii ooooo  
[echoed breath]

lyrics = [intro]
Soft whispers under moonlight  
Piano keys caress the night  

[verse]  
In your eyes, a world unfolds  
Stories of love, tales untold  
iiiiiiii  

[chorus]  
Hearts entwine, under the stars  
Dreams align, near and far  
ooooooo  

[bridge]  
Gentle touch, a promise made  
In this dance, we serenade  
ahhhhhh  

[outro]  
As dawn breaks, a new start  
Passages of the heart  
iiiiiii

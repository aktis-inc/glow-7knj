[verse 1]
In the twilight's embrace  
We find our way  
Hearts whisper secrets  
In the city's sway  
zzzz

[chorus]  
ooooo  
Our love ignites the night  
Fires burning bright  
Together we'll stand  
Hand in hand  

[bridge]
Flames dance in our eyes  
Underneath the skies  
We hold on tight  
Through the endless night  
ahhh

[outro]
soft echoes fade  
iiiiiiii

oooooooo

[verse - bamboo whispers]
Serenity in whispers  
Grove's gentle embrace  
Harmony in echoes  
Nature's soft lace

[melodic interlude]

Rising light, calm flow  
Bamboo tells stories  
In harmony, we grow  
Nature's gentle glories

[outro - serene fade]
[echoing flute]  
ooooooo  
shhhhhhhh

ahhh ooohhhh iiiii  

[verse 1 - Rhythm Echo]  
In the heart of the forest's dance  
Voices rise in sacred trance  
oooo eeeee  

[Chorus - Beat Pulse]  
Feel the earth beneath your feet  
iiiiiiiiiiii ooo  
Dance to the ancient beat  

[Bridge - Spirit's Call]  
Whispering winds through the trees  
Songs of the past float on the breeze  
ahhhh eeeeee  

[verse 2 - Nature's Harmony]  
Leaves rustle, tell a tale  
Of spirits that never fail  
ooooo iiiiiii  

[Outro - Fade to Silence]  
Echoes linger in the night  
Under the stars, hearts take flight  
ahhh ooohhhh iiiii

lyrics = [intro]
ooooooo  

[verse - Gentle Breeze]  
In the whisper of the night,  
dreams take flight,  
beyond the horizon,  
where stars ignite.  
mmmmmm  

[chorus - Soft Glow]  
woooooo  
Carry me, oh gentle tide,  
to where the heavens reside.  
ahhhh  

[bridge - Tranquil Echo]  
In the stillness, I find peace,  
a world where worries cease.  
shhhhh  

[outro - Fade to Calm]  
ooooo  
Rest in the quiet,  
where dreams align.

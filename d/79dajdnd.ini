lyrics = [intro - Beach Horizon]
aaaaaaahhhhh
oooooooooooo
[sound of waves]

[verse 1 - Gentle Breeze]
arena cálida bajo los pies
el tiempo se desvanece lento
palmeras susurran secretos
ninguna preocupación alcanza aquí

[Pre-Chorus - Rising Tide]
iiiiiiiiiiiiii
la luz nos envuelve suave
dejando todo atrás
solo el ritmo del mar

[Chorus - Sun-Kissed Drop]
uuuuuuuuuuuuuu
solace now, in the heat
every worry melts away
dive deep into the blue
this is where I want to stay

[verse 2 - Salt Kissed Skin]
saboreando el aire fresco
la brisa acaricia mi piel
risas flotan en el aire
un mundo nuevo, sin ayer

[Pre-Chorus - Rising Tide]
iiiiiiiiiiiiii
la luz nos envuelve suave
dejando todo atrás
solo el ritmo del mar

[Chorus - Sun-Kissed Drop]
uuuuuuuuuuuuuu
solace now, in the heat
every worry melts away
dive deep into the blue
this is where I want to stay

[Bridge - Golden Hour]
[instrumental break with synth lead]
ooooooohhhhhhhh
[sound of seagulls]
el cielo se tiñe de naranja y rosa
cada instante, un tesoro guardado

[Chorus - Final Wave]
uuuuuuuuuuuuuu
solace now, in the heat
every worry melts away
dive deep into the blue
this is where I want to stay

[Outro - Fade Out]
[sound of gentle waves]
aaaaaaahhhhh
ooooooo
solace...

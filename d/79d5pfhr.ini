[verse 1]
City lights, a river of colors
Where stories dance in the air
Every heartbeat echoes louder
Feel the rhythm everywhere
ooooo iiiii

[Pre-Chorus]
Listen to the echoes, flying high
In the pulse of the night sky

[Chorus]
wooooo
Dance with me, in the quiet echoes
Feel the beat, let your spirit follow
wooooo
ooooo

[Bridge - Lively]
In the streets, alive with stories
Every step, a new memory
ooooo iiiii
[echoing laughter]

[verse 2]
Voices blend, tales intertwine
Where the music never ends
In this moment, we’re divine
Let the city be our friend
ooooo iiiii

[glitch rise]
shhh woooo

[outro - Celebration]
Feel the pulse, feel the beat
In the city, where we meet
ooooo iiiii
[fade out]

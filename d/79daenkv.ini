lyrics = [intro - Moonlit Prelude]
soft air iiiii  
echoing heartbeats  

[verse 1 - Whispering Winds]  
In the garden of lost dreams  
Silent echoes of our seams  

[Pre-Chorus - Heartbeat Echo]  
oooooo  
pulsing through the night  
Feelings hidden from sight  

[Chorus - Soulful Call]  
ooooo aaaaaaa  
Whispers of the heart  
Underneath the starry art  

[Bridge - Emotional Crescendo]  
gentle iiiii  
ooooo  
In the calm, we find our part  

[outro - Dream Fade]  
soft iiiooo  
fade into night

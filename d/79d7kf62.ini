lyrics = [intro - mystic whispers]
oooooo  
iiiiiiii

[verse 1 – Rain's Embrace]
In the dance of falling drops  
Ancient whispers weave their spell  
Harmony of earth and sky  
Resonate, echo, dwell  
ooooooh

[Chorus – Celestial Dance]  
ahhhhhh  
iiiiiii

[Bridge - Ethereal Flow] 
Soundscape of dreams, a timeless trance  
In rhythm's embrace, we find our chance  
Ahhhhhh  
[raindrop echoes]

[verse 2]
The sitar sings a story old  
Tabla beats, a heart unfolds  
In this dance, the world aligns  
A melody of endless signs  
zzzzzzhhhhh

[outro - Whispering Fade]
softly into night… (oooo-yeah!)

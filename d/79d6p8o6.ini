lyrics = [intro - Desert Echoes]
whispering winds  
ooooo iiiiiii  
[verse 1 - Dance of Sands]  
In the desert's embrace, rhythms play  
Echoes of time, in vibrant array  
[Pre-Chorus - Mirage Pulse]  
ooooo  
Melodies weave, stories untold  
Under the stars, where dreams unfold  
[Chorus - Rhythmic Wave]  
aahhhh  
Dance with the breeze, wild and free  
iiiiiiiii  
[Bridge - Harmonious Horizon]  
Voices unite, in harmony's glow  
Desert tales, in every shadow  
[Outro - Sunset Reverie]  
ooooo aaaahhh  
Rhythms fade, but spirits remain  
In the desert's heart, forever they reign

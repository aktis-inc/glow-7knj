[verse 1 - Village Life]
In the heart of chatter, tea cups clink
With stories woven, smiles that link  
ooooooo iiiiiii

[Chorus - Joyful Echo]
Echoes of laughter, in the sun's glow
Life's a dance, and we all know  
yyyyy ooooo

[Bridge - Tradition Meets Modern]
Old tales told with a modern twist
In harmony, the past and present kissed  
ahhhhhh eeee

[verse 2 - Shared Moments]
Gathered 'round, beneath the banyan tree
With every sip, another memory  
zzzzzz hhhhhhh

[Outro - Laughter Fades]
Laughter fades but never ends
In every heart, it still sends  
ooooooo iiiiiiii
[fade out]

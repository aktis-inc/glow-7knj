[verse]
In the quiet glow
Beneath the sapphire sky
Dreams unfold with the tide
Gentle as a sigh
oooooo

[chorus]
Veil of sapphire, hold me close
In the echoes of the night
Waves whisper stories untold
Beneath the moon's soft light
iiiiiiii

[bridge]
Footsteps in the sand
Mark paths we trace alone
Yet here we find our home
In the sapphire's gentle tone

[outro - Fading Light]
ooooooo
The night wraps us in its embrace
A tender, timeless space
shhhhhhh ooooo

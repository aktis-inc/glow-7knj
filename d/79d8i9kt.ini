lyrics = [intro - dawn whispers]

[verse 1]  
In the quiet of morning light  
Reflections dance on water's edge  
Silent dreams take gentle flight  
Hearts awaken from their pledge

[Pre-Chorus - Gentle Rise]  
oooooo  
Whispers of the past, they linger  
Fingers trace the sky's embrace

[Chorus - Morning Glow]  
oooooooo  
In echoes of dawn, we find our place  
Softly, time drifts without a trace

[Bridge - Reflections]  
aahhhh  
In every ripple, stories unfold  
Memories weave in threads of gold

[verse 2]  
The world stirs in soft embrace  
Silent melodies fill the air  
In the stillness, we find grace  
With each breath, our souls repair

[outro - Serene Fade]  
iiiiiiii  
As the sun rises, so do we  
In the echoes, we are free

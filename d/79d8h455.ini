[verse 1 - Echoes of Time]
In the neon glow, shadows dance  
Steps trace paths of old  
A gentle breeze carries whispers  
Stories of life unfold

Chimes of the past, calling

Dance with the future, embracing

Can you hear the echo?
The city's heart beats with life

Evolving under the night sky  
Tradition meets the future's gaze

The journey continues, endless  
Through the echoes of time

lyrics = [intro - Whispered Reflections]

[verse 1 - Echoes of Silence]
In twilight's embrace, shadows dance,  
A melody of whispers, lost in trance,  
Through veils of time, hearts collide,  
In echoes deep, secrets hide.  

[chorus - Soul's Reverie]  
oooooo  
Harmonies weave through the air,  
Carrying dreams, light as prayer,  
In the stillness, voices rise,  
A symphony beneath the skies.  

[bridge - Crescendo of Stars]
oooooo  
iiiiiii  
In twilight's glow, emotions sway,  
Guided by stars, we find our way,  
Each note a tear, each chord a sigh,  
In harmony's echo, we fly.  

[outro - Fading Echoes]
ooooo  
Whispers fade, yet linger still,  
In the heart of darkness, echoes thrill.

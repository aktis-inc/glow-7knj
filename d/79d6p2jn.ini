lyrics = [intro pulse]

[verse 1]
In electric dreams we rise  
Through neon skies we fly  
Echoes of the storm ignite  
Our hearts, our minds, tonight  
oooooo  

[Pre-Chorus – Surge]  
Thunder echoes, whispers loud  
In this city, electric shroud  
iiiiiiii  

[Chorus – Lightning Dance]  
Feel the pulse of the storm  
ooooooo  
Let the rhythm transform  
wooooo  

[Bridge - Neon Veins]  
City lights, our guiding stars  
Electric love, no more scars  
ahhhh  

[verse 2]
Through the night, our voices soar  
In this dance, we find more  
Vibrant echoes, endless waves  
In this storm, we're brave  
sssssshhhh  

[outro - Electric Fade]  
With every beat, we're alive  
Echoes of lightning, we survive

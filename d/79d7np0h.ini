[verse]
Distant echoes call through time
In the city's glow, we find
Traditions woven with the new
Under skies of vibrant hue

[build-up]
ooooo iiiii
Rhythms pulse, ancient and true
City's heart beats in tune

[chorus]
Unbounded echoes, they carry us
Through stories lost, and futures thrust

[bridge - traditional fusion]
oooo aaa
Resonance of ages past
In the present, shadows cast

[outro - fade]
Whispers of the neon night
Traditions blend, futures ignite

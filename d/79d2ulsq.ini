[verse]
In the city's heart, a pulse ignites
Melodies weave through the night
Ancient echoes, modern dreams
In every note, magic redeems

[pre-chorus]
Oooooo aaaaa
Rhythms intertwine, timeless and new
Boreal dance, a radiant view

[chorus]
Eeeee ooooo
Night unfolds in vibrant hues
Under the stars, we find our cues

[bridge]
Mystical whispers, tales untold
In the music, secrets unfold
Shimmering dreams, bold and bright
Boreal night, endless delight

[outro - fading harmonium]
Aaaaa eeee
In the silence, echoes remain
Boreal night, in every refrain

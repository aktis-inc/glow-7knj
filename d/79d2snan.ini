lyrics = [intro - Whispering Dawn]

[verse - Serene Path]
Ancient echoes call
Through misty valleys we roam
Guided by the light

[chorus - Ethereal Dance]
oooooo aaaaaa
Voices blend with stars
In the silence of the night

[bridge - Timeless Echo]
Time's gentle embrace
Whispers of the seraph's song
In dreams, we find peace

[outro - Fading Light]
oooo iiiii
Fade into the mist
Eternal echoes remain

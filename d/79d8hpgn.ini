lyrics = [intro]
(Spoken) Just another day, nothing special

[verse 1]
Wake up, make some coffee
Feed the cat, check my phone
Same routine, same old story

[chorus]
oooooooooo
Living my everyday normal life
No superheroes, no crazy nights

[verse 2]
Walk to work, pass the same faces
Small talk, laugh at bad jokes
This is my everyday oasis

[bridge]
Ahhhhhh
oooooo
Just a guy, living in the mundane
Finding joy in the little things, again

[outro]
(Spoken) And that's alright with me

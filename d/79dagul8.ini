lyrics = [intro - Thunderous Echo]

[verse - Sparks Fly]
Beneath the neon glow, shadows dance
Flames flicker in the electric trance
oooo oooo

[Pre-Chorus - Rising Heat]
Deep in the night, hearts ignite
Feel the rhythm, take flight
iiiiiiii

[Chorus - Blaze]
Burn brighter, in the city's embrace
Lost in the fire, find our place
wooooooo

[Bridge - Ember's Whisper]
Whispering dreams, in the night's embrace
Weâ€™re the echoes, in this endless chase

[verse - Night's Pulse]
Through the rain, we find our way
In the city's heart, we sway
zzzzzz zzzzzz

[outro - Ember Glow]
Softly fading, as the night slows
In the silence, the ember glows

[verse 1 – Backwater Echoes]
Through neon-lit streams  
Whispers in the breeze  
Traditions dance anew  
In vibrant harmonies  
ooooo

[Chorus – Pulse of the Past]
iiiiiiii  
Rhythms of the heart  
Echoes of the start  
ooooo  
iiiiiiii

[Bridge – Fusion Flow]  
Tradition meets the future  
In every beat, a culture  
Oooooo aaaaa  
[soft percussion]

[verse 2]
Sailing through the glow  
Stories only rivers know  
In the pulse of night  
Melodies take flight  
ssshhhh

[outro - Drift to Harmony]
ooooo  
Through whispers and dreams  
In glowing streams  
iiiiiiii

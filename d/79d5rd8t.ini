lyrics = [intro - Neon Pulse]

[verse 1 - Urban Mirage]
Luminous streets call my name
In shadows, I play the game
Dreams in electric haze
Lost in the neon maze

[Chorus - Illusion Dance]
oooooo  
Dance through the illusion, reality's fusion
Feel the beat, let it take control
wooooo  

[bridge - Echoes of Light]
City lights whisper truth  
In the night, we find our youth  
oooooo  
iiiiiiii  

[outro - Fading Glow]
As the night fades away
In the dawn, dreams sway

lyrics = [intro - Desert Echo]
(whispering wind) sssssssss
ooooooh

[verse 1 – Sand's Embrace]
Under stars, secrets dance
Whispers carried by the sand
Tradition meets the future's glance
Soulful tunes in desert's hand
oooo

[Chorus – Oasis Dream]
iiiiiiiiiii
Mystical echoes, hearts align
In the desert, tales intertwine

[Bridge - Mirage Fade] 
Souls entwined, in the night
Voices calling, distant light
Ahhhhhhhh

[verse 2]
Lion's roar, silent grace
In this realm, time's embrace
Melodies of oud, a timeless space
oooooo

[outro - Wind's Caress]
shhhhhhh oooooo
Desert's lullaby, echoed sigh

[Verse 1 - Mythical Echo]
In the realm of echoes, secrets untold  
A dance of light, myths unfold

[Chorus - Divine Dance]

In shadows, whispers call  
Celestial dreams enthrall

[Verse 2 - Enchanted Harmonics]
Floating on ethereal tides,  
Where time and space collide

Mystical chimes, guiding light  
Through the night, spirits take flight

[Chorus - Divine Dance]

In shadows, whispers call  
Celestial dreams enthrall

[Outro - Whispering Winds]  
sssssshhhh  
Dreams of old, in whispers retold  
iiiiiiii

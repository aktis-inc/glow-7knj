lyrics = [intro brass]
(Playful horns) oooooo
(Upbeat drums) iiiii

[verse 1 - Neon Skies]
Langit kota berpendar
Dalam gemerlap malam
Suara tawa, langkah cepat
Hanya bayang-bayang

[Chorus - Street Symphony]
ooooooo
Cahaya dan suara
Membingkai cerita kita
iiiiii

[Bridge - Midnight Dance]
Di jalanan ini, kita berdansa
Dengan irama malam
ahhhhh
oooooo

[verse 2 - Echoed Laughter]
Rindu pada cerita lama
Terselip di antara nada
Ska dan punk bergema
ooooo iiiiii

[outro - Fading Lights]
(Slow brass fade)
Kota kembali tenang
Tapi ritme tetap berlanjut
shhhhhhhh

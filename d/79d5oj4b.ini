ooooo
(soft whispers) Pyar ki aag mein...

[verse 1 – Flames Dance]
Dil ne kiya hai vaada
Raaton ki narmi mein

[Chorus – Eternal Ember]
oooooo
Jalne do, jalne do
Pyar ka junoon...

[Bridge - Melodic Sway]
Sitar ki lehron mein
Dil se dil milte hain

[outro - Heart's Whispers]
(soft tabla) Dhak dhak dhak
Kumar ke geet jaise...

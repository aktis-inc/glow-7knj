[verse 1 – Ember Glow]  
In the city of lights, where dreams ignite,  
We dance to the rhythm of a thousand stories.  
oooooo  

[chorus – Fire Dance]  
Feel the heat, as the music takes flight,  
With every beat, we rise to new heights.  
iiiiiiiiiiiii  

[bridge – Luminous Path]  
Guided by echoes of forgotten tunes,  
We find our way through the neon dunes.  
oooo aaaaa  

[outro – Fade to Dawn]  
As the night fades, our spirits remain,  
In the embers of melody, we find our refrain.

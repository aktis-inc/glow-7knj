[verse]
Pulsing lights in city veins  
Echoes of a past untold  
In shadows dance, we break the chains  
Stories in the night unfold  
oooo

[chorus]
Revelations in rhythm flow  
Hearts beat with the city's glow  
iiiiii

[bridge]
Neon dreams, we chase the night  
In the pulse, we find our flight  
aaaaa

[outro]
Whispering through time's embrace  
Riddley guides our endless race  
shhhhhhhh

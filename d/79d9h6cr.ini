lyrics = [intro - Enchanted Prelude]

[verse - Whisper of Time]  
Through the corridors of memory  
A melody dances with fate  
Glimmers of once and forever  
In the echo of whispers, we wait  
ooooo aaaaa  

[chorus - Timeless Serenade]  
Heartbeats align, where dreams reside  
In rhythms of the heart, we glide  
iiiiiiiiii  
ooohhh  

[bridge - Ethereal Interlude]  
Veils of stardust, gently fall  
Tales entwined, we hear the call  
ahhhhhh  

[verse - Melodic Echo]  
Lost in the weave of moonlit threads  
Harmony guides where the silence treads  
iiiii ooo  

[outro - Luminous Fade]  
As the past and present blend  
In the symphony, we transcend  
oooo iiiiiii

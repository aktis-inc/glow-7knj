[verse 1 - Tides of Memory]
In the whisper of waves
Where time softly plays
A sailor's heart sways
oooooo

[chorus - Echoes of the Past]
Melodies deep, stories untold
Under the stars, dreams unfold
iiiiii

[bridge - Soul's Serenade]
Lost in the ebb and flow
Where only the heart knows
zzzzz

[outro - Drift Away]
Sail on, through the night
Guided by the moon's light
ooooo iiiiii

[verse 1 - Ember’s Whisper]  
Burning pages, dancing light  
Stars ignite, in endless night  
oooooo iiiaaa  

[Chorus - Celestial Rhythm]  
Fires blaze, hearts in trance  
Under the stars, we dance  

[Bridge - Cosmic Flow]  
Tradition meets the future's glow  
In this dance, we lose control  
aaaaa ooooo  

[outro - Flickering Fade]  
Fading embers, whispers of stars  
In this dance, we are ours  
zzzzzz hhhhhh

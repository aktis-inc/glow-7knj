shooooo

[verse - whispers]
Solitude hums
In echoes of time
Mysteries unfold
In the silent chime
ooooooo

[chorus - ethereal]
iiiiiiiiii
Whispers of the past
Flow through the air
Mystical dreams
Beyond compare

[bridge - transcendence]
shhhhhhh
Ethereal light
Guides the way
In silence, we find
A new day

[outro - serene fade]
oooooo aaaaaa
Solitude remains
In the heart's domain

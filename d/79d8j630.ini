[verse]

Sketching lines in shifting sands  
Under the blazing sun's command  
Whispers of stories old and grand  
iiiiii aaaaaa

[chorus]

Drawing dreams in the desert's hand  
Footsteps vanish, but the echoes stand  
oooooo iiiiiii  

[bridge]

Wandering through the dunes alone  
Every grain a world unknown  
zzzzzzhhhhh

[outro]

In the desert, tales are drawn  
Before the night, before the dawn  
oooo aaaaa

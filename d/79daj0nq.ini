(softly) iiiiiii

[verse 1 - Nature's Call]  
Viento canta, hojas bailan   
Ritmo en la tierra, eco en el alma  
Latidos del bosque, corazón de agua  
ooo iiiii aaaa

[Chorus - Harmony Dance]  
woooooo  
Las voces se entrelazan, ohhhhh  
Tierra y cielo, su melodía

[Bridge - Earth Echo]  
Sonidos del sol, vibrante despertar  
oooo aaaa  
iiiiii

[outro - Wind Embrace]  
Susurros se desvanecen, en el aire  
Ahhhh iiiiiiii oooooo

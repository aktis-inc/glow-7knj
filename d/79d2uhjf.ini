[verse]
oooo  
Bunga di taman, tarian jiwa
Alunan gamelan memanggil
oooo

[Pre-Chorus - Unity Flow]
Pada malam yang penuh cahaya
Kita menari dalam harmoni
iiiiii

[Chorus - Celebration Pulse]
oooo  
Gerak kita selaras alam
Tari cendrawasih, angkat jiwa

[Bridge - Spirit Dance]
Angin membawa pesan lembut
Tarian ini adalah doa

[outro - fading echoes]
oooo  
Dalam keselarasan, kita temukan damai

[Verse]
Softly, the night speaks  
Under the moon's gentle glow  
Ancient tales unfold

[Chorus]
ooooooo  
iiiiiiii  
Hearts entwined in shadows

[Bridge - Echoes of the Past]  
sssssshhhh  
Voices of the ancients  
murmuring in the breeze

[Outro - Desert's Lullaby]  
Dreams carried by the sand  
to the stars above  
Ahhhhh oooooo  
[fade into silence]

oooooo

[verse 1 – Ember's Glow]
In the silence, shadows dance  
Heartbeats echo in the night  
Eyes that speak, a timeless romance  
Flickering flames, soft and bright  
iiiiiiii

[Chorus – Eternal Embrace]  
wooooo  
oooooo

[Bridge - Whispered Promises]  
Hand in hand, through the fire  
A melody that never tires  
ahhhhh

[verse 2 – Rekindled Dreams]  
In the warmth, the world retreats  
Sparks that fly, a gentle beat  
Memories weave through tender sheets  
In this moment, we're complete  
zzzzz

[outro – Fading Light]  
oooooo
iiiiiiiiiiii

lyrics = [intro - Night Vibes]
(whispered) city lights, they call to us
ooooo  
iiiiiiii

[verse 1 – Digital Dreams]
Walking through echoes, neon reflections
In the night, find my direction
Lost in thoughts, heavy introspection
The city breathes, a digital connection
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[Pre-Chorus – Echoed Steps]  
[soft synth]
oooooooooo
Sacrifices echo, in the silence we grow
Whispers of the past, in the night's glow

[Chorus – Nocturnal Pulse]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii

[Bridge - Shadow Dance] 
Dreams collide, in the urban tide
Stories untold, in the city wide
Ahhh shhhhhh  
[echoed breath]

[verse 2]
Through the alleys, where shadows meet
Every corner holds a beat
In the darkness, find my feet
The rhythm guides, my heart's retreat

[synth build-up]  
ssshhhh oooo  

[distorted whisper] echoes in the night… (oo-yeah!)

[outro - Fade to Dawn]

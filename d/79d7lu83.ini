whhhhhoooo  
eeeeoooooo

[verse]  
In the echoes of time, we dance  
Past and present in a trance  
Strings of fate gently weave  
Stories of old, we believe  
shhhhhh

[chorus]  
Harmony in the night  
Guiding stars in sight  
ooooo  
iiiiiiiiii

[bridge]  
A tapestry of dreams and sighs  
In the silence, truth lies  
wooooooo

[outro]  
Eternal whispers fade  
In this moment, we're made

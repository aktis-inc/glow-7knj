sssssshhhhhh
Floating above
In silent dreams

[glitch - soft chimes]

[verse - mellow drift]
Softly we breathe
In time with the sea
oooooo iiiiii

[chorus - whispered breeze]
Yearning in the breeze
Soft and free
oooooo

[bridge - ambient glow]
iiiiii aaaaaa
Drifting past
The world's quiet plea

[outro - fading whispers]

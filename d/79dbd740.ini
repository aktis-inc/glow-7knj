ooooooo

[verse]
In the garden, shadows play  
Memories dance in yesterday's light  
Sitar strums, whispers stay  
hearts beating in the quiet night  
aaaaa

[chorus]
Beneath the moon's gentle glow  
iiiiiiii  
Your name echoing, soft and slow  
ooooooo  
Dreams tangled in the flow  
Of time, where love used to grow

[bridge - timeless interlude]  
oooo  
Sitar and flute entwined  
Emotions hard to find  
In echoes of the mind

[outro - fading whispers]
woooooo  
Gentle breeze through the leaves  
Love's whisper, never leaves  
iiiiiiii  
ooooooo

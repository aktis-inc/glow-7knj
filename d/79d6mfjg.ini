lyrics = [intro riff]

[verse 1]
In the shadows of the towers
Silent whispers drift away
Each note a fleeting hour
Lost in the folding day
ooooo iiiiiiiii

[Chorus – Echo's Cry]
Lonely echoes call my name
In the city's endless frame
iiiiii aaaa

[Bridge – Solitary Pulse]
Guitar wails in solitude
City's heart, a hollow tune
Ahhhhhh ooooo

[verse 2]
Neon lights, a ghostly glow
Casting shadows far below
In this realm of silent woe

[outro - Fading Light]
iiiii aaaaaa
The echo fades, a distant sigh

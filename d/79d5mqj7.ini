[verse]
In the quiet of the morning light
Where whispers weave through trees
We found a song that feels just right
A tune that sets us free
oooooo

[Chorus - Rising Harmony]
Echoes in the stream iiiii
Where dreams and hearts collide
We drift upon this gentle beam
In love's eternal tide

[Bridge - Soft Reflection]
Where the river meets the sky
We sing our lullabies
In the chorus of the night
We find our way, we fly

[outro - fading echoes]
ooooooo iiiiiii
Beyond the river's gleam, we fade into the dream

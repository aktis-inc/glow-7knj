[verse - Echoes of Kinship]
In the quiet of the night, our stories intertwine  
Threads of memory, in the tapestry of time  
ooooo  

[chorus - Starlit Embrace]
Under stars, hearts align  
In whispers, we confide  
iiiii

[bridge - Bonds Unseen]
Silent vows, unbroken, we hold  
Across the ages, stories retold  
shhhhh  

[outro - Gentle Fade]
Together, we find our way  
In the echoes of yesterday  
ooooo iiiii

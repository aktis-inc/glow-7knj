[verse]  
Gentle whispers in the night,  
Tides that dance with neon light,  
Floating dreams in twilight's glow,  
Secret currents softly flow  
iiiiiiiiii

[chorus - Ethereal Echo]  
oooooo  
Tidal waves of sound,  
In the city's bound,  
Echos of the heart,  
Never drift apart  
aaaaaaaaaa

[bridge - Dream Drift]  
Glowing pathways in the mist,  
Each reflection, a gentle twist,  
Urban symphony of stars,  
Guiding us from afar

[outro - Fade]  
Whispers fade into the dawn,  
As the city dreams on and on  
ooooo iiiiii  
[soft chime fade]

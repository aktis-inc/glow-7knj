lyrics = [intro - Neon Glow]
ooooo iiiiiii

[verse 1 - Shadow Walk]
Neon lights guide the way  
Through the city's endless gray  
Silent whispers in the rain  
Lost in thoughts, feeling the strain  
eeeeee

[Chorus - Echoes of Goodbye]  
woooo  
Goodbyes under neon skies  
oooo  
Heartbeats fade, truth never lies  

[Bridge - Urban Pulse]  
City's hum, a lullaby  
In this maze, we learn to fly  
shhhh ooooo

[outro - Fading Lights]  
iiiiiiiiiiii  
Neon dreams, fading bright  
In this world, we seek the light  
ahhhhhhhhh

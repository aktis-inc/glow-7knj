[verse 1 – Echoes of Time]
Dalam senja yang lembut
Masa lalu datang berbisik
Kenangan seperti angin
Membawa cinta yang pernah ada

[Chorus – Whispered Memories]
ooooooo
Semua yang hilang, kembali
Di antara gelombang, kita berdansa

[Bridge - Silent Shores]
iiiiii
Waktu berhenti, kita tenang
Dalam bisikan, hati bergetar

[outro - Fading Light]
oooooo
Lampu meredup, kenangan menetap
Di pantai sunyi, kita bermimpi

lyrics = [intro]
Rustling winds  
oooooo  
City whispers

[verse 1 – Urban Pulse]  
Shadows creep in alleys deep  
Echoes of dreams lost in sleep  
Streets alive with silent cries  
Underneath the neon skies  
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[Chorus – Quicksilver Flow]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii

[Bridge – Defiant Echo]  
Through the chaos, we rise  
Our voices, the city's ties  
Ahhh shhhhhh

[verse 2]  
In the night, truth unfolds  
Stories untold, hearts bold  
We stand, we fight, we hold  
Resilience, our gold

[outro - Fade to Silence]  
ssshhhh oooo  
Whispered echoes… (oo-yeah!)

lyrics = [intro rhythm]
dhol beats echo
laughter in the breeze

[verse]
in fields of gold we dance
under starlit skies, so bright
with every step, a story
in the rhythm of the night

[chorus]
oooooo
iiiiii
laughing through the storm

[bridge]
flute calls, hearts awake
in this joyous storm we make
ooooo
iiiiii

[verse]
colors swirl, night unfolds
in the dance of the bold
each beat a heartbeat, strong
with the storm we belong

[outro]
rhythm fades
clap echo

lyrics = [Intro - Echoes]
oooooo  
iiiiiiiiiiii

[Verse - Shadow Steps]  
Through the rain, I wander  
Each droplet a memory  
Heartstrings pulled asunder  
In the city's silent plea  
ooooo 

[Chorus - Heart's Lament]  
iiiiii  
Feel the pain, hear the call  
In the echoes, we will fall

[Bridge - Neon Tears]  
Soft whispers in the dark  
A melody of the heart  
Ahhhhhhhhh  
[soft flute]

[Outro - Fading Light]  
oooooo  
In the shadows, we depart  
With the echoes of a heart

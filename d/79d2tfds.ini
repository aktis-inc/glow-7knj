lyrics = [intro - Neon Echo]
oooooo
iiiiiiii  
[verse - Twilight Stroll]
Glittering streets call my name
Echoes of yesterday linger
In the glow, we chase the night
oooooo
[Pre-Chorus - Luminous Dreams]
Fading shadows, whispered secrets
Steps in sync with time's embrace
[Chorus - Reflective Dance]
In this moment, we're alive
Neon colors paint the sky
oooo  
iiiii
[Bridge - Memory Lane]
Past and future intertwine
In these echoes, we find solace
[verse - City Lights]
Every corner holds a story
In the glimmer, dreams arise
oooo
[Outro - Aural Reflections]
Fading into the night's embrace
Where memories softly glow]

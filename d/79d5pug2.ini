lyrics = [intro - gentle breeze]

[verse 1]
In the whisper of the night
Your eyes are stars, softly bright
Holding on to dreams we weave
In the air, we softly breathe
oooooooohh

[chorus]
With you near, the world stands still
In our hearts, a gentle thrill
iiiiiiiiii
Together in this tranquil light
Our souls take flight, tonight

[bridge]
Time slows down, in your gaze
Lost in this tender maze
wooo oooohhh
Embrace the warmth we feel
In this love, so real

[outro - wave fade]
In the air of affection
Our love’s gentle reflection
ooooooh iiiiiiiii

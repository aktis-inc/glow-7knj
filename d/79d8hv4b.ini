lyrics = [intro - Mystic Dawn]

[verse - Temporal Whispers]
Silent echoes of the old world  
Carried on the wings of time  
Light dances on forgotten paths  
In shadows, secrets unwind  
ooooooo iiiiiii

[Chorus - Celestial Chorus]
Across the stars, voices call  
iiiiiii aaaaa  
Boundless realms, where dreams fall  
woooooooo  
In the quantum echoes of it all  

[Bridge - Cosmic Waltz]
Gentle winds, they weave the tales  
Of lands unseen, where spirit sails  
Eternal, the dance of light and shade  
In whispered songs, the universe is laid

[outro - Twilight Fade]
Floating through the cosmic sea  
Eternal echoes, wild and free  
zzzzzzhhh iiiiiii ooooo

lyrics = [intro - Soft Glow]
ooooo  
Soft whispers in the night  
Stars align, hearts ignite  

[verse 1 - Celestial Touch]  
In your eyes, a galaxy  
Every glance, a melody  
ooooo  
In the silence, we find grace  

[Pre-Chorus - Cosmic Dance]  
Whirling in the starlight's gaze  
Every beat, a timeless phrase  

[Chorus - Orion's Embrace]  
wooooooo  
Held by the night, in Orion's arms  
ooooo  
We're endless, no alarms  

[Bridge - Heartbeat Echo]  
Eternal rhythm, endless skies  
In your touch, the universe lies  
ahhhhh  
[whispered echoes]

[verse 2 - Starlit Journey]  
Together, we chase the dawn  
Every moment, a love song  
ooooo

[outro - Celestial Fade]  
In Orion's Embrace, we stay  
Forever and a day  
oooooo

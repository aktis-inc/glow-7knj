lyrics = [intro]
oooooo  
ahhhhhh

[verse 1 – City Whisper]
Through crowded streets, echoes align  
A glance exchanged, a cosmic sign  
oooooo

[Chorus – Heart's Embrace]  
Together we dance, under the stars  
In kaleidoscope hearts, love unbars  
iiiiiii

[Bridge – Serene Glow]  
Two worlds collide, yet blend so true  
In melodies of red and blue  
ahhhh

[verse 2 – Timeless Bond]
Across the time, our spirits roam  
Finding solace, making it home  
oooooo

[outro]
In tender whispers, we remain  
Kaleidoscope hearts in love's domain  
iiiiiii

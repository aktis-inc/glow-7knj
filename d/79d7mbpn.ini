lyrics = [intro - gentle stream]

[verse - whispering breeze]
Across the waves, whispers call  
In the embrace of the unseen  
Dreams weaving through the night  
A melody from the heart's core

[chorus - ethereal rise]
oooooooo  
iiiiiiiiiiii  
In the veil of dreams, we soar

[bridge - serene reflection]
Silent echoes, tender grace  
Sitar sings, tabla speaks  
Through the whispers, we find peace

[outro - distant horizon]
Waves caress the shore  
In the quiet, we find more  
oooooo  
iiiiiiiiiiii

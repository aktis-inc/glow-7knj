lyrics = [intro]
Soft whispers of the wind ooooo

[verse 1]
Under skies that shift and sway
Thoughts drift in quiet streams
Every cloud holds a memory
In its tender seams

[chorus]
iiiiii  
Beneath the vast expanse, we wander
Seeking truths in the gentle glow
Hearts whisper secrets, softly ponder  
In the twilight's tender flow

[bridge]
ooooo
Gentle hues of fading light
Guide the way through the night
ooooo

[verse 2]
Steps echo on the path unknown
Yet the heart feels at home
With every breeze, a story's sown
In the whispering dome

[outro]
Under the shifting skies, we dream iiiiiii

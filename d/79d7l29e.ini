lyrics = [intro - Soft Rain]
oooooo

[verse 1]  
In the shadow of your voice, I stand  
Every word a silent echo  
Heartbeats like distant thunder  
In the space where we once danced

[Chorus - Echoing Heartbeat]  
wooo ooooooo  
Tears fall like rain  
Names whispered in vain  
iiiiiiii  
oooooo

[verse 2]  
Beneath neon reflections, I walk  
A journey of forgotten promises  
Your memory, a haunting melody  
In the streets of our past

[bridge - Strings of Paradox]  
oooooo  
A dance of pride and vulnerability  
Heartstrings pull, oh how they deceive  
ooooo  
iiiiiii

[outro - Fading Whisper]  
In the rain, I find my peace  
Your shadow fades, but echoes remain  
ooooo  
wooo ooo oooo

lyrics = [intro synth]
(어두운 밤에)
(네온빛 속에)
oooooo  
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

[verse 1 – Electric Flow]
도시 속을 가로질러
네온빛 속에 춤을 춰
너의 손길이 날 끌어당겨
우린 멈추지 않을 거야
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[Pre-Chorus – Pulse Surge]  
[soft synth]
oooooooooo
우린 빛처럼 빠르게
이 밤을 타고 날아가

[Chorus – Neon Drive]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii이야야야

[Bridge - Starlight Beat] 
우린 별빛을 따라가 (yeah!)
이 순간을 영원히 (oh!)
Ahhhhhh shhhhhh  
[echoed breath]

[verse 2]
너와 나의 세계 속에
끝없이 펼쳐진 길
우린 함께면 두렵지 않아

[synth build-up]  
ssshhhh oooo  

[distorted whisper] 우리 길을 밝혀… (oo-yeah!)

[outro - Neon Fade]

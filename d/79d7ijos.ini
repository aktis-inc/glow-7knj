lyrics = [intro - Neon Pulse]

[verse 1]
Through the mist, where dreams collide  
Reflections dance in neon light  
Voices whisper, secrets hide  
In the city, hearts ignite  
oooooo iiiiii

[Pre-Chorus - Electric Glide]  
[soft synth rise]
Never fading, never still  
Chasing shadows, bending will

[Chorus - Urban Dream]  
wooo  
ooooo  
Through this life, we ride the thrill  
In the night, we find our fill

[Bridge - Haze Break]  
In the city, dreams unfold (uh!)  
Stories told, but never old (yeah!)  
Ahhh shhhhhh  
[echoed breath]

[verse 2]
Past and future intertwine  
Weaving tales in rhythm's line  
In the pulse, we find our sign  
Lost and found, forever mine

[drop - Bass Surge]  
ooooo  
ssshhhh 

[outro - Fade to Dawn]

[verse 1 - Moonlit Thoughts]  
In the quiet of the night, whispers find their way  
Through the silver light, dreams softly sway  
ooooooooo  
  
[bridge - Sapphire Flow]  
[soft strum]  
Beneath the sapphire sky, hearts align  
In the river of time, moments intertwine  
  
[chorus - Liora's Embrace]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii  
Embrace the silence, feel the glow  
In Liora's whisper, let it flow  
  
[verse 2 - Starry Promises]  
Promises woven in the stars above  
Gentle echoes of a timeless love  
ahhhhhhhh  
  
[outro - Tranquil Fade]  
[soft hum]  
The night sings a lullaby, tender and true  
In the warmth of Liora, hearts renew  
shhhhhhh
